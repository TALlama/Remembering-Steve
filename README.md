## What's all this, then?

When the new [Remembering Jobs](http://apple.com/stevejobs) page landed, I immediately thought it was a fitting tribute; so many people around the world shared what they thought of this man that none of us knew ([myself included](http://explodedclown.trainedchimpanzeeband.com/221-missing-steve/)), and here was a small selection of their thoughts. But seeing them all scroll by they seemed so ephemeral, and I wondered what the whole looked like.

I popped open Safari's WebKit Inspector and saw that it was pulling down the remembrances one at a time, and they were JSON formatted. About five seconds later I was writing the ruby script to do so myself.

## Word Cloud

Once I got everything downloaded I made a nice [word cloud](http://bit.ly/sj-wordcloud), which you can see here:
