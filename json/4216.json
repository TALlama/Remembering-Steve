{"mainText":"Steve extended a hand to me in a time when I was running out of options. His apple products introduced me to a whole frontier to channel my design skills thru. Expressing my creativity, conveying stories, sharing photos, illustrations and publishing stories made such an impact on me and all those who became apple fans...became Steve Jobs fans.\n\nSteve shared in his vision a plan for what could and should be before we knew we needed or wanted it. Eventually we came to expect great things from the company and no doubt never appreciated all the hard work and sacrifices all involved gave to make those products, those visions.  \n\nBehind every great company and leader, stands a loyal, equally passionate crew of hard working staff. Remember your client base is behind you and support you.\n\nA life-long apple fan.\n\n\n\n\n","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Mike","location":""}
