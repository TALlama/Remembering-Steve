{"mainText":"Today we truly lost a great innovator and person. I don't have a iPhone, iPad, or iPod but I know of the brilliance it took for Mr. Jobs to create such world changing products.&nbsp; He is the quintessential American dream, from nothing to more than something truly amazing.&nbsp; We should be so lucky to have just known him and to learn from him.&nbsp; Learn that failure will not keep you down, hard work will take you places, and being something is beyond being rich.&nbsp; I can confidently say if we all live like Mr. Jobs, the world would be a better place. Thank you. &nbsp;&nbsp;","header":"Truly sad day","author":"Hanson","location":""}
