{"mainText":"To say that Steve inspired me would be an understatement. I respected his pursuit of the new. The way he spoke about new product releases at Apple affirmed his passion and belief in each and every product, and easily made me a believer. Each keynote he gave, I downloaded and watched as if it were destination television. Each product release drew my husband and I to our local Apple Store, knowing something transformational - and even a little bit magical - surely awaited us. We were never disappointed.\n\nBecause of Steve, I came to truly believe that passion, drive and natural curiosity could take you further in life than any degree from any school you might attend. That working a retail job could be fulfilling and like no other retail job I'd ever had before. Steve taught me the power of simplicity.\n\nMy life will forever be changed because I knew of Steve Jobs. His work changed the world. His words changed how I live in it.&nbsp;","header":"Here's To The Crazy One","author":"Rochelle","location":""}
