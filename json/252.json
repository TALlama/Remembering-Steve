{"mainText":"Some kids grow up aspiring to be great rock stars or astronauts. Some kids want to be glamour models or great heroes in the forces. Some kids want to grow up to be a leader, some want to be millionaires.

I will forever remember where I was on this day.","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Kraig","location":"from Scotland"}
