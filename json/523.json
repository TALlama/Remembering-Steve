{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was a visionary that will forever be remembered in the world \nof technology and in our hearts. Though I have never had a chance to know him, I feel his passion through \nthe products that I currently use on a daily basis. Without his \ninspiration and guidance none of the technology today would be available \nto me. I have grown up knowing and using the evolution of his work and I will \nforever remember him. I know you are in a better place now with no suffering and I hope you \nwill watch over us from the skies above. Rest in Peace Steve Jobs.","header":"A Forever Remembered Visionary","author":"Tiffany","location":""}
