{"mainText":"The world has lost a great man...a visionary of the best kind. He was  \na DaVinci of our time. I never knew him personally and yet tears come  \nto my eyes. I have lived by the statement... once you go Mac, you  \nnever go back... and I certainly will always be an Apple lover. May he  \nrest in peace and may his many friends bring comfort to his family.","header":"greatness","author":"Anne","location":"from Indiana, USA"}
