We are all so blessed to have benefited from his genius. God bless you Mr. Jobs. He was so devoted to the improvement of technology. I pray that his family realizes the impact that he had on 'everyday people' l\nike me. My tears are flowing for the loss of such a great and quiet man.","header":"Long live Apple!
