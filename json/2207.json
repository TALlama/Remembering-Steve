{"mainText":"I never knew Steve personally, but I always admired his hard work and\ndedication to bring back a near (bankrupt) company into a multi-billion\ndollar organization. He changed the way the music industry works, and\nintroduced the world with iPods which made our music life a lot easier.\nSteve was a genius and a dedicated man, and its sad to see him go. Steve was\na one of a kind man, and its hard to see him go. My condolences to Steve,\nand his family, and hope this email helps.\n","header":"RIP Steve Jobs 1955-2011","author":"Alec","location":""}
