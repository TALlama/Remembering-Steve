{"mainText":"Somehow I suspected it wouldn't be too much longer before Steve left us. \n Even knowing this, I still can't help but feel as if a large part of my \nlife has just left.  Even though I didn't, and probably never would have \nhad a chance to know him personally, I can't help but look around my \nhome and office and know how much he has influenced a large part of my \nlife and business.\n\nMy condolences go out to his family, friends and his adopted family \nmembers that he worked with closely on a day to day basis.\n\nSteve, you will be sorely missed but remembered for many lifetimes to \ncome.\n","header":"My words for Steve","author":"Ken","location":""}
