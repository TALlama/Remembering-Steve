{"mainText":"I'm sorry to hear about the recent tragedy, even though I wasn't a huge fan of Apple, I still understand what Steve Jobs did and how it shaped the technology we're given today. &nbsp;And I respect him for that. &nbsp;He will always be remembered in my heart as a mastermind and a genius in the technology world. I hope when I grow older I wish I could even achieve a percentage of what he has accomplished.\n\nWith love and sympathy.\n","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Joe","location":""}
