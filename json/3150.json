{"mainText":"Dear Steve\n\nThank you for sharing your brilliance and innovation with the world. Your creations have helped so many and took away any intimidation people felt towards using a pc. It's amazing to see my child hop on my iPhone and figure out how to work it before I could. And he was only 6 at the time. May god bless you in heaven.  You will be missed by those who knew and love you and by a world which you made so much better.","header":"Thank you Steve Jobs","author":"Neela","location":""}
