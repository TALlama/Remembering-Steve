{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was a true hero. He fought for the same world that I fight for every day. His innovations gave us a glimpse of the world and how it ought to beâ€¦how it can be. He showed us that that world is possible, and that it is such a wonderful place. I paid the market value for his products, but his efforts are worth much more to me. He lived by no standards other than his own, and he never lowered or compromised them for anyone. He loved his life, and my life is so much better because of him. I feel like I lost a friend today. Thank you, Steve Jobs. Rest in peace.","header":"Remembering Steve Jobs","author":"Autumn","location":""}
