{"mainText":" I had no idea how attached I was to Mr. Jobs until just a few minutes ago when I pulled out of a studying haze and checked my email to see the news of his death. I am absolutely tech illiterate but have come to depend on Apple for beautifully functioning products that let me use a device rather than be confused by one. I am deeply grateful to Mr. Jobs and the rest of the Apple for their creativity, efforts, and amazing will to make these products affordable for the average American. I am deeply saddened by this news. My heart goes out to Mr. Jobs's family, friends, and everyone at Apple.\n\nMy sincere sympathies","header":"RIP","author":"Sophie","location":""}
