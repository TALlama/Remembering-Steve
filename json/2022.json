{"mainText":" What an amazing human being. When I was 15, i received my first apple computer in 1984 and have not stopped to marvel at his genius, and have loved the culture of Mac that Steve built. Though I only met him once, he was one of the few people that I looked up too, and visioned of working at Apple ever since.  \n\nLet his legacy be that he has developed not only a company that builds technology equipment but of creating the culture of Mac that so many have joined and relished over the last 30 yearsâ€¦.A way of life for millions of people that the rest of the world only now is beginning to understand.  \n\nGod bless you Steve and may you live forever in our hearts&nbsp;","header":"","author":"Christopher","location":""}
