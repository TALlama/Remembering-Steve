For making the inspiring world that was previously\nreserved for geeks and nerds accessible to everyone. Without Apple, I\nwouldn't have a job as a Final Cut Pro editor. I wouldn't be able to find\njust the song I needed when I'm feeling down. And I wouldn't have learned\nthat true magic is achievable with the right mix\nof innovation, perseverance, and leadership.\n\nRest in peace, Steve.","header":"Thank you, Steve...","author":"Scott","location":"from Atlanta, Ga."}
