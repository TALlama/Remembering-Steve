{"mainText":"I've through this email, to offer my condolences to the honorable man Steve Jobs. My English is not of much use, but I always had great admiration for this man.\nAll citizens who knew and admired his work feel a great loss not only in America but also around the world. \nI currently live in Brazil and despite the little knowledge I have about this amazing man, I can say I'm really saddened by this loss so early. \nMay he rest in peace and your path be illuminated by divine light, God bless.\n\nAfter a great living, Steve Jobs and his teachings has to be taken as an inspiration to future generations. \nThank you for this opportunity to express my feelings for the loss of a man who for me will always be a global icon.&nbsp;","header":"My Concolences","author":"Alessandro","location":"from Brazil"}
