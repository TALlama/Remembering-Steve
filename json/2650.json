{"mainText":"I'm not a computer person. And that is why Steve Jobs had such an impact on me.\nHe made computing relevant to everyone. He made it possible for me to, not\njust use, but thrive using computers. He had the vision to take technology\nout of the tech bubble and apply it to the real world. Very few individuals\nhave made such a direct impact on the world.\n\nIt is rare that an individual I have never met would have such an impact on\nme. My first computer at home was the 1984 Macintosh (I was born in 1986, we\nused that computer until I was in elementary school). I now have a 2011\nMacBook Pro. When I was three, I was about as competent on that computer as\nmy mother (except that I couldn't read and could only write gibberish). I\nused to type gibberish into some program on that computer and it would\n(attempt) to read it back to me. I now take videos on my iphone.\n\nThanks, Steve. for the knowledge, the discovery, and the fun.\n\nAnd my condolences to those of you lucky enough to have had him as a boss, a\nmentor, a friend or a family member.\n","header":"Thanks, Steve","author":"Katie","location":""}
