{"mainText":"To the Jobs Family:I was so sad to read of your loss and I would like to extend my sympathies to you. Steve was an inspiration to me and so many other people who come to Silicon Valley- and California\n- to strike out on their own, with little more than an idea and the belief \nthat their dreams are not only worth pursuing, but can change the world around them. Steve was the true embodiment of the American dream and his comeback that most in the business world would have thought impossible was only \nthe first of many- you have no idea how inspiring that is to so many people\n who often have nothing but the belief in their dreams and abilities. I know the days ahead will be difficult, but I hope that your grief is abated, even slightly, by all the millions of people who were inspired by him and mourn with you and for your loss.\n","header":"condolences","author":"Jessica","location":""}
