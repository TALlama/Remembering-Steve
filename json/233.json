{"mainText":"Rest in peace Steve Jobs. Thank you for all the amazing staff you invented through your life. Thanks to your knowledge, I can use all these amazing staff, such as an iMac, which I am using to write this short, but significant paragraph. Thanks to you I could hear my music wherever I want, with my iPod. Thanks to you I can use a tablet, which is much easier to carry. You really did something good for the world. You changed it. I don’t have words to thank you for everything you did.\nTHANK YOU STEVE JOBS. REST IN PEACE.","header":"Peruvian Teenager’s feelings about Steve Job's death","author":"Maria","location":"from Peru"}
