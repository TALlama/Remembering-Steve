{"mainText":"I just hope Steve knew how much he was appreciated. He touched the world \nin ways he probably didn't know. I know majority of the products that \ncome from Apple are as a result of all the talent there but his vision \nand guidance and ability to look into the future helped shaped the \ncompany. Steve has been an inspiration to me, I wish I was able to meet \nhim in person to express my appreciation for his passion that showed in \nthe products he made. He did make the best products in the world. He \nreally did care about the users as it showed in the products he made. We \nlove you steve.","header":"A legend","author":"Kanayo","location":""}
