{"mainText":"What do I write? You were an inspiration to me. You completely changed the way I approached everything.  I found myself quoting you without realizing it, not because I knew everything about you, but because the few times you spoke it was so meaningful. You have changed my life more than you will ever know and I hope I can in some way impact the world as you did.\n\nMy condolences to your family.&nbsp;","header":"I can't even describe.","author":"Andrew","location":""}
