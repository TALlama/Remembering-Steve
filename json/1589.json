{"mainText":"I have tears in my eyes as I am writing this Email. I never met Steve Jobs in person but I had a relationship with him through his great apple inventions. I happened to own almost every Apple product and have been so proud of each one of them. Very often I would stack my MAC book, IPAD, IPOD &amp; I PHONE and say look I am APPLE crazy. I always said there is nothing like a Mac or an iphone and all other apple products. &nbsp;What a human being Steve Jobs must have been. What a vision he had to bring out all this. My heart is hurting and crying. I feel sad beyond words. May God rest his soul.&nbsp;","header":"Steve jobs leaves us.","author":"Rukhsana","location":""}
