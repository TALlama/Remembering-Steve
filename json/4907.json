{"mainText":"I was never blessed to meet Steve personally, but watching him on stage \ni could feel it, his amazing presence he had that affected EVERYONE he \nstood in front of. It was him doing what he loved that lit up the stage. \nI really missed this presence during the last apple conference and i \nknow i was not alone in that feeling. But i take peace in knowing that \nhe was with his family. He was so young and i am praying for peace to \nhis wife and family in this time of need. I know apple will NEVER be the \nsame, but i also know that all who remain have the same love for apple \nthat Steve did, and therefore Steve's touch will be on every future \nproduct we see from apple. I will miss him and am so sad at this news \ntoday! God bless the family and close friends.&nbsp;","header":"Remembrance","author":"Crystal","location":""}
