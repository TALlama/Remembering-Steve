{"mainText":"Thank you Steve for all that you have given us over the years.  Thank you for your Vision, your Creativity, your Dedication to seeking Perfection in all you did and all you created.  Thank you for giving us tools and toys we didn't even know we would need or want.  Thank you for all the \"insanely great\" machines from the Apple II to the first MAC, the IPODS, the IPHONES and the IPADS.  Thank you for building the greatest computer and consumer products company on the planet.  Thank you for building a team who will continue to follow your vision and build on your legacy.  You truly changed the world.  And the world is a lesser place without you in it.  True visionaries come to us maybe once every hundred years or so.  You will be greatly missed by all.\n\nPeace be with you and your family and all of your extended Apple family","header":"Thank You Steve","author":"Dan","location":""}
