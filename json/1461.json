{"mainText":"When I first started in the crazy ad biz, I was a 22-year old African American woman and my first job was at Chiat/Day. &nbsp;At my orientation, I saw the \"1984\" spot and thought, \"Damn, I really like this whole advertising thing! And who the heck is Steve Jobs?\"\n\nWell, I never got the chance to meet Steve, but I thought then and always have ever since, that he probably has no idea how much he's done for humankind. &nbsp;I will miss his genius, his simple way of thinking and how he really made us all better. How lucky and blessed we all are to experience his genius.\n\nWhat a man.\n\n\nLisa&nbsp;","header":"I'll always remember Steve","author":"Lisa","location":""}
