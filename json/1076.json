{"mainText":"I sit in front of a Mac every day since 1988. Had my first Macbook in 93.\nGray plastic. My first printer was a LaserWriter II. I use a PowerBook\ntoday. I was one of the few who had a Newton. Today I have an iPhone 4, an\niPad2 and a Silver Mac. My work and my life had been powered by Apple.\nApple design has always been great and Steve presentation and speeches\nalways inspiring.\nI think we designers will be very sad without Steve.\n\nThank you for giving us all that wonderful ideas, tools and inspiration.\n\nGood bye Steve.","header":"Good bye genius","author":"Rafael","location":"from Mexico City, Mexico"}
