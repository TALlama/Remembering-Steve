{"mainText":"There are too many things I'd like to say. He has given the world a light of hope; made it braver, brighter and smarter. As I write this email from my iPhone, the rest of the world's Apple products are probably roaring with activity throughout the rest of the world. If there was ever such a thing as world peace, Steve Jobs' creations brought the world just a little closer together. Because of Apple, I got a chance to start a life and career I never thought i could have. So thank you Apple, Thank You Steve Jobs. \n\nWe love you and will miss you. The world tonight is united for the first time in human history. \n\nPlease give my condolences to his closest friends and family. My prayers go out to him.","header":"Thank you Steve","author":"Alessandra","location":""}
