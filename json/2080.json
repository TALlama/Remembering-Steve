{"mainText":"I'm an artist and a graphic designer, and I just wanted to say that because\nhe did what he loved (and did it well), Steve Jobs has let me do what I have\na passion for as well. Without his creativity and inspiration, I wouldn't\nhave the tools to do what I do. Apple facilitates a lot of my creative\nprocess, and makes my life so much easier. I couldn't imagine trying to get\nby without my macbook, ipod, or iphone. He was truly an inspiring person.&nbsp;","header":"Thankful.","author":"Shelby","location":""}
