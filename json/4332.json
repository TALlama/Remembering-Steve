{"mainText":"Dear Steve, his family and friends,\n\nI have so much of my life to owe to Steve and everyone at Apple. I've \ngrown up alongside the meteoric rise of the company and Steve had so \nmuch to do with that. His contribution to the company has meant a great \ndeal to me, as your products I use everyday have inspired me into a love \nfor technology and a wonderment for what is yet to come. I can honestly \nsay that without Steve, myself and millions of other people wouldn't be \nwho they are today.\n\nThank you for everything you've done.\n\nRIP Steve.\n","header":"RIP Steve Jobs","author":"Neil","location":"from United Kingdom"}
