{"mainText":"Anybody who knows me knows that since my purchase of an Apple Lisa computer\n- the forerunner of the Macintosh - in late 1983, I have been a devoted\ncustomer of, and yes, stockholder in Apple. I frankly would not want to\ncount how many Apple computers, iPods, iPhones, etc. etc. I have owned in\nthe last 28 years. \n\nThese products have been for me more than just tools or toys or gadgets. I\ncan honestly say that much of what I have accomplished in my life has been\ndirectly connected to how, in the words of Apple marketing slogans, they\nencouraged me to \"think different(ly)\" and gave me \"the power to be your\nbest.\"\n\nToday's passing of Steve Jobs isn't just the loss of another corporate CEO.\nMost of us don't have a single original idea in our lives. A handful of\npeople have one original idea, and enjoy great success. Steve Jobs literally\nchanged the world four times: 1) He is, at very least, the co-father of the\npersonal computer and its reinventor with the Macintosh; 2) His ownership of\nPixar has led to the most staggering string of high-quality, critically and\ncommercially successful animated movies in history; 3) The iPod and iTunes\nhave radically changed the way virtually all of us listen to music; 4) The\niPhone and the iPad have defined mobile computing and communications for our\nage.\n\nSteve Jobs had the power to dream with his eyes wide open, and in his own\nwords, skate to where the puck was going to be. He changed our world and our\nlives, even for those who have never used an Apple product. And in an era\nwhen so much seems to be broken, he gave us all a glimpse of what it is like\nfor something to \"just work.\"\n\nThe world won't be the same without him.\n\nRalph","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Ralph","location":"from California"}
