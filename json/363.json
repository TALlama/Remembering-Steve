{"mainText":"The world has lost a incredible mind today.  Steve Jobs was the creative genius of our time and his contributions to society can not be over stated.  His time here was too short, but in that brief time he changed our lives in ways we never imagined were even possible. In that brief time, he gave us technology that we never imagined, but then then couldn't imagine living without. In that brief time, he changed the way we work, the way we play, and the way we interact with others.   In that a brief time, he changed the world, by putting it in the palm of our hands. In that brief time, Steve Jobs taught all of us that our time is limited and not to waste a single precious moment.  A message he preached and practiced!  What an inspiration Steve Jobs has been!&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs Changed The World","author":"Elizabeth","location":""}
