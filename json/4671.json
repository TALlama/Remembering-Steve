{"mainText":"I am so sorry to hear that Mr. Jobs passed away today.  Since the mid-80's,\nI can't think of a time when I did not own an Apple device.  Mr. Jobs knew\nwhat I needed before I knew I needed it.  I will miss his appearances at\nproduct launches because he explained to me how the product he was\ndemonstrating could make me more productive (e.g., my iPad) or better yet\nhow I could rediscover the joy of assets I already owned (e.g., my iPod\nTouch).  Mr. Jobs, I will miss your vision.  Rest in peace.&nbsp;","header":"my condolences","author":"Bill","location":"from Maine&nbsp;"}
