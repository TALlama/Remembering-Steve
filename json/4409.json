{"mainText":"I was a fan of Apple before it was cool. From my first MacII CX I was  \nhooked on Apple. As a graphic designer and owner of a small commercial  \nprinting company I have experienced the magic first hand. From the  \nearliest days of running primitive Pagemaker I would have nothing but  \nMacs. I am so glad Steve was around to grow the company to the  \npowerhouse it is today.\n\nMy condolences to his family and friends. He will be missed.&nbsp;","header":"Visionary Man","author":"Rodney","location":"from Lexington, NC&nbsp;"}
