{"mainText":"Dearest Apple,\n\nSteve Jobs was my idol since I was little. I'm 12 years old now and I treasure and love Apple Inc. more than most things in my life. When I heard the news of this tragic death, I started crying. My desktop background on my new MacBook is now the picture you have on your website, tributing Steve Jobs. I have also set all statuses to \"Rest in Peace, Steve Jobs. I will always love you, you are my idol &lt;3:'(\" I am so sorry for your loss, it was the loss of the most amazing person on the face of the earth and I believe Apple will get through this. I give all of my love and support to you. He will always be with you, watching over Apple as a sort of guardian. He will always be present in our hearts. I love you, Apple. I love you, Steve Jobs. Rest in peace.&nbsp;","header":"Rest in Peace, Steve Jobs","author":"Liana","location":""}
