{"mainText":"I am a fairly new customer to Apple. At least in the aspect of the \nMacintosh operating system. I am sorry for your loss; but not just your \nloss but mine as well. Steve had a great way of running things which \ncreated this amazing operating system i fell in love with. Please don't \ndestroy what Steve spent his life building. I trust he left Apple in \ngood hands and i want you to do it like Steve would. Thank you.&nbsp;","header":"Steve","author":"Justin","location":""}
