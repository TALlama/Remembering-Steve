{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\n\nsorry for my English, but I want to write because I feel sorry for your death. The staff that you have forged says just saying that \"Apple loses a mentor but above all a dear friend\". All of us, Apple customers and not, lose a great person. That empty chair at the keynote was given to you, but now you look around from there.\nApple is more than just a company. Is something magical: is your inspiration. And that no one ever will remove that.\n\nThanks Steve for being the brilliant person who has made ​​life easier for millions of people.\n\n\nA big hug.\n","header":"Condolences","author":"Andrea","location":""}
