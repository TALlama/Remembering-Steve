{"mainText":"I never met Steve Jobs. And i wouldn't have to had my life changed by  \nhim.\nLike me, thousands had the same luck, in a time where our lives are  \nbombed with bad news, tragedy, wars...where the people most talked  \nabout are Osama Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, etc...or the topics are  \nwars, economic crisis, pollution... Steve brought to us not just joy, color, design... he brought  \nintegration, technology, information, put people together even they  \nare thousands miles away.\nHe made the word impossible something out of his life, and we should  \nall learn from him.\nThe world lost a great man, a great revolutionary, a great leader.\n\nGodspeed Steve, and we all mac lovers see you soon. Thanks you very  \nmuch.&nbsp;","header":"I never met Steve Jobs...","author":"Edoardo","location":""}
