{"mainText":"I saw Steve speak one time, in Cambridge Massachusetts at a tech convention\nin the late 1980's.  Steve was showing his latest NeXt computer.  Here he\nwas, in front of the East Coast techies, who thought well of themselves.  He\nwas all alone with a couple of slides and that iconic NeXt cube computer\nthat had no mouse, keyboard, screen, nothing.  Just a cube.  He gave his\nopening, then went into Q&amp;A.  He won over each questioner one-by-one, and\nthe audience.  Not only was he convinced that the NeXt was superior in every\nway, but everyone in that audience knew it too.  I will never forget that\nmoment.  Thank you Steve.\n","header":"A Cambridge Massachusetts memory...","author":"Bill","location":"from Cambridge, MA"}
