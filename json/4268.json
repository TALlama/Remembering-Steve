{"mainText":"I would like to thank Steve for the imagination he has instilled, the breakthroughs he has made, the foundations he has built and the innovations he has pioneered. You don't have to be a fan of Apple products to know how truly amazing steve was. He changed the world and the way we think. He made me believe that any task can always be done better. The world has said goodbye to one of the greatest minds that ever set foot on earth, he is not just a mentor to his employees but a mentor to the people.\n\nI am truly saddened by this news.\n\nWhat a great man! That's all that can be said. RIP Steve, your up in the iClouds now!","header":"Steve Jobs - A Pioneer&nbsp;","author":"Ryan","location":""}
