{"mainText":"It's almost hard to believe considering yesterdays Apple presentation and\nall the positive vibe. I'm speechless, Apple products and design has been\npart of my life since I was 12, I'm 33 now. It inspired my career as a\ndesigner in so many ways. Steve Jobs and Apple not only created amazing\nproducts, but brought technology and user closer together like no other\ncompany. His vision will be missed, and I hope someone at Apple learned\nenough from this genius to keep bringing his vision for decades to come. ","header":"Speachless","author":"Filip","location":""}
