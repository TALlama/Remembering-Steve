{"mainText":"I never knew Steve, but it is obvious how much of an impact he has made\nWORLDWIDE.  His vision of beautiful, functional technology has set the\nstandards for modern technology that is used on a daily basis.  There are\npeople all over the world carrying Steve's legend in their pocket right now,\ntyping on his creations right now, watching TV through his products right\nnow.  Apple/Mac would not be what it is today without Steve.  Technology\nwould not be what it is now without Steve.  I'm sure those closest to him\nwould not be who they are today without Steve.  It is always sad to lose\nsomebody of such importance.  My condolences to those closest to Steve...\n","header":"sad...","author":"Derick","location":""}
