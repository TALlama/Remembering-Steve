{"mainText":"We saved hard and bought our 1st Apple II when they came into the UK, as designers we knew personal computing was the way to go and Apple was the machine that made us go Wow! \n\nSince then I have used an Apple product every day. For many years I had to endure other machines at work but coming home was always good because my latest Apple was there. \n\nMy Son is 24 years old, as an infant he learnt to stand by operating an Apple IIe with a joystick. He has never looked back and now has a career as a software engineer coding on Macs and on these he strives to always write the most elegant code.\n\nI am grateful that I shall enjoy these retirement years of my life with Apple products keeping me online, informed and entertained. The Wow! has never ceased.\n\nFor the past 30 years and the years to come, \n\nI Thank You, Steve Jobs.\n\nMy condolences to The Jobs Family and all Apple Company members.","header":"Thank you, Steve Jobs","author":"Lesley","location":"from <br>"}
