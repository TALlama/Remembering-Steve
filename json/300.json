{"mainText":"I think it is very telling that I write this to you on a MacBook Pro,\nwhich I think Steve would be proud of. We have lost a visionary, a\npioneer and an adventurer. Nothing will ever be quite the same again.\nI never knew him but I am upset. He was such a revolutionary thinker\nand he always had a new way to do things. My sincerest sympathies to\nhis family. He will not be forgotten. His legacy lives on in\ntechnology that we all use and love using. I think he'd like that. He\nsaw what we should be doing and now, we're doing it! He was a\nmarvellous man!\n","header":"My condolences","author":"Robert","location":""}
