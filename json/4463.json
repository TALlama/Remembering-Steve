{"mainText":"I remember the first time I got an iPod. I fell in love on the spot. Who knew a simple music player could be so much more than just that? It became a part of me that I carried everywhere.&nbsp;\n\nThe day that I got my first iPhone was one of the happiest days of my life. It instantly transformed into an extension of my own arm. I did't leave the house without it. I used it for anything and everything.&nbsp;\n\nWhen I started to watch the Apple Keynotes presented by Steve Jobs, I was entranced. I believed what he was telling me about and wanted to have the product he was describing. He made Apple cool.&nbsp;\n\nTo this day I respect Steve Jobs' diligence and faithfulness towards Apple, even unto his dying breath. He has revolutionized the way I think about technology. He raised the bar and set a standard that no one could match but Apple itself. He made Apple what it is today. Steve Jobs is Apple.&nbsp;\n\nHe will forever be remembered as the greatest innovator in the world of technology. Thank you, Steve. You succeeded in doing the impossible: making your products extremely simple and beautiful, and with that, you have moved mountains.&nbsp;","header":"I Remember","author":"Preston","location":""}
