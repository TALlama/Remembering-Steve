{"mainText":"Such an amazing gift had Steve Jobs.  I remember using our only Mac  \nClassic amid a sea of Apple IIe units, and marveling at the wonderful  \ntouches... that the design(er) seemed to anticipate needs, wants, and  \nthe comfort and convenience for the end users.\nIt takes a strong empathetic mind to be able to create something that  \ncould satisfy and touch such a diverse user base.  Truly a gift from  \nGod to Steve Jobs, and ultimately, to us, the body of Apple users.\n\nTo all who knew and worked with Steve, my sympathy for your loss.\nCertainly, his spirit will live on through the marvelous works of his  \nmind and hands that Steve Jobs shared with us all.&nbsp;","header":"Condolences to the family and Apple community on the loss of Steve Jobs","author":"Linda","location":""}
