{"mainText":"I so fondly remember my first Apple product. I drove frantically 70 miles\nafter work one day to the Keystone Apple Store in Indianapolis just to\npurchase my first Apple computer - a PowerBook G4.\n\nI waited first in line on campus for the release of Panther throughout Snow\nLeopard. I couldn't wait to see each WWDC. Every release was so exciting.\n\nI enjoy all technology, but there has been something really special about\nthe last few years and Apple.\n\nI never knew you, but felt close. I'll miss you Steve.","header":"I'll remember you Steve","author":"Weldon","location":""}
