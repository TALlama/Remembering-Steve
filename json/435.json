I studied\nseveral of\nhis keynotes and public appearances and tried to understand the genius.\n\nI don't think that there is someone around that can match his level and his\nachievements.\n\nA true hero and unfortunately he will not be able to see his next big\nmasterplan, the new Apple Campus.\n\nI'll miss him....I'll be an Apple fan forever!","header":"What an inspiration mr.
