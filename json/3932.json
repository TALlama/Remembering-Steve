{"mainText":"R.I.P Steve Jobs...You'll be missed...you founded an awesome company, got fired by them, came back to them when they were at their lowest point, brought the mac back to life, made iPod a household name, when the doubters said, \"what does a computer company know about making a phone!!\" You made iPhone a household name and now billions and billions of people enjoy your product and it helps them out with their everyday lives. Steve Jobs was an innovator and had a great vision for his company, may you find peace... I can only hope to one day get a job with the company that you help found....Truly an innovator and like someone else quoted, \"the apple of america's eye!!\"","header":"steve jobs","author":"jimmy","location":""}
