{"mainText":"HI, I AM AN APPLE BABY.  I KNOW NOTHING ELSE.  I HEARD THE NEWS AS I WAS SYNCING MY IPHONE ON MY MAC NOTEBOOK.  \nMY IPAD ALREADY KNEW.  APPLE IS MY WHOLE WORLD AND STEVE WAS AN ANGEL SENT TO US TO HELP US SEE THE GOOD \nIN THE CORPORATE WORLD.  GIVEN THE CURRENT STRUGGLE WITH WALL STREET I HOPE WE CAN CHERISH THE VISIONARY \nMAN AND CARRY ON THE LEGACY HE FOCUSED HIS LIFE ON.  IT IS A WHOLE APPLE AND WE CAN ALL TAKE A BITE.  I AND MY \nFAMILY WILL MISS HIS AMAZING CONTRIBUTION TO OUR WHOLE LIFE.","header":"MY WHOLE APPLE","author":"PAULA","location":"from CASTRONOVA"}
