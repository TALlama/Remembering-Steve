{"mainText":"\nSteve Jobs was a visionary. One could say that he led us to the modern world that we have here, with the iPods and the iPads and the iPhones that dominate our news industries every day. But he was also responsible for creating a computer. A computer that ended up revolutionizing the world as we know it. I'm just a kid, and I never had the chance to know Mr. Jobs personally, but it was clear that he put his heart into Apple and his soul into it, and that's what makes him an exceptional human being. In this, he is a legendary figure, (not was, because his contributions to the world will always be here) but at the same time, a regular guy like the rest of the world...doing what he loved. In that, I am sad that I never knew the man beyond his public image, but clearly he was always something more. A visionary, a regular guy, a fighter. All of these words are part of what is and always will be Steve Jobs. Millions of people enjoy his legacy and in that, we are but shadows underneath it. So I offer my condolences to his family and friends, and I hope you all feel just a little bit better after seeing this letter, made by this kid.\n\n\n \t\t \t   \t\t  ","header":"My condolences","author":"Aryaman","location":""}
