{"mainText":"Steve was always ahead of his time but that never stopped him. He should \nbe remembered for what the younger generation can be capable of. Steve \nwas once young like many of us and never stopped pursuing anything he \nwanted, we should all live like it is our last day. In the world we live \nin today where everything is connected, mostly thanks to Steve himself, \nwe should always be creating and pursuing. His life will be celebrated.","header":"RIP Steve Jobs","author":"Andrew","location":""}
