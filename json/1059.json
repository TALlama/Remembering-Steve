{"mainText":"Steve taught us all to \"think differently.\" His 2005 commencement address to Stanford is something I keep in my desk drawer when I forget why I do what I do. Not having attended Stanford, I read the speech in the newspaper then. I have kept it in my desk drawer ever since. That speech reminds me to \"stay hungry and foolish,\" to listen to my own intuition and let it guide me to where I need to be.\n\nHe was the original crazy one, misfit and trouble maker. He was a true genius.\n\nI extend my condolences to his wife Laurene, his children and his entire family. Thank you for sharing him with all of us.&nbsp;","header":"Thank you","author":"Liz","location":""}
