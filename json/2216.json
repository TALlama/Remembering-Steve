{"mainText":"My daughter has born in the same day that the iPad was announced to\nthe press. Today she plays with her iPad with an incredible ability:\nshe can browse videos, choose apps, play games, turn on/off the\ndevice. For her, all of it is something very common.\n\nI stay very happy when I see her playing like this because I know she\ncan do it because one man one day dreamed about it. And dedicated his\nlife to make this dream real.\n\nThank you Steve, thank you to make our lives full of magic. Thank you\nto transform technology in something more than a box full of\npossibilities, but a bright screen of happiness.&nbsp;","header":"My daughter and her iPad","author":"Bernardo","location":"from Brazil"}
