{"mainText":"What a sad sad day. I never met him but he inspired me so much throughout my\n life. What he accomplished was akin to the Thomas Edison &amp; Albert Einstein\n's of the world and even though it is crazy for someone who has never met him, I felt so sad inside when I found out.  He inspired me to dream about&nbsp;technology in a way that no one else has or probably ever will.  For that I am selfishly sad to here of his passing &amp; think he won't continue to inspire me like he always has.  My prayers are with him and his family tonight. Thank you steve, thank you!","header":"Steve","author":"Ed","location":""}
