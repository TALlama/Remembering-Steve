{"mainText":"There wouldn't be smartphones in this world if it wasn't for Mr. Jobs. The\nword app would just have been some archaic term. The innovations that became\navailable only through a Mac wouldn't have existed with out you Mr. Jobs.\nThough I lie on the competitive side, no one can deny the innovation and\npossibilities you made possible through Apple.  I pray for peace, comfort,\nand strength for the family and loved ones of Steve Jobs. RIP Steve Jobs,\nyou will be missed.","header":"Condolences","author":"Carlos","location":""}
