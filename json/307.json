Thank you for your beautiful mind, your inspiration and your insight to build a better place for people to reach out, to begin to know one another in a personal way, bridging cultural, social, and economical difference.  You will always be remembered with the greatest of minds, removing the delineation of place... in communication, in harmony, and in lifestyle shrinking a world that seems so vast with a click of the mouse.&nbsp;","header":"Good bye","author":"Lily","location":""}
