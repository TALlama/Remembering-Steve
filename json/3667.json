{"mainText":"It's seem to be the saddest news of this month. I use Apple because of you, I love the way you attract people and show them what Apple is. Really, i still can't believe now you've gone. My son cried when he heard you will leave Apple and he was disappointed when he didn't see you in \"Let's Talk iPhone\". I got the same feeling. You are legend Steve, Mr. Magic. Good bye Steve, you are always the best!! My idol, rest in peace, I love you, I love Apple!!\n","header":"We love you, Steve","author":"Alex","location":""}
