{"mainText":"It takes an amazing visionary to create something from nothing, leave it behind and then breath life into it a second time. Jobs created much more than Apple computers - he created a way of interacting with a machine and made it feel like it was an extension of your hand and mind. Apple will be hard pressed to find that kind of vision again and I only hope (and I feel hopeful that) the company can pool it's collective consciousness and continue what Jobs started.\n\n\n","header":"huge loss","author":"Robert","location":""}
