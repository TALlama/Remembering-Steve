I am fairly new to the Apple world but have grown up with Steve's vision from my early childhood. I am saddened by Steve's departure but he will live on in our hearts forever. He has built a great empire and has bestowed on us great products and tools for young and old so we too, can become genius.\n\nApple forever!","header":"RIP Steve from OZ","author":"Heico","location":""}
