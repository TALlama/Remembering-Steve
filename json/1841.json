{"mainText":"As I sit here surrounded by my Apple products I am saddened beyond description by the great loss of Steve Jobs.  My life has been greatly enhanced by the many years of innovative products that have always been years beyond their\n time.  Apple has always been more than just another pc company. My Apple products are a part of my daily life and I would never want to be without them. This is the legacy that Steve left, the emotional connection between man and computer. There will never be another Steve Jobs and I send my deepest sympathy to his family, friends and the wonderful employees of Apple.&nbsp;","header":"Thank You Steve","author":"Craig","location":""}
