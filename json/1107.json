{"mainText":"I am very saddened by the world's loss of Steve Jobs. He was one of my Heroes and is someone I had always looked up to. A lot of the stuff Steve and the Apple team have done has changed the world in a good way and I deeply appreciate all the things you and Steve have done. He is definitely someone I would have loved to meet and thanks at some point in time, since he is someone who has indirectly taught me a lot about technology and innovation. I will truly miss him, not as just an innovator, but as a person and professional. I will never forget the things he and his team have brought to the world and will always remember him as a true individual.","header":"Dear Apple Team","author":"Patrick","location":"from Massachusetts"}
