{"mainText":"&nbsp;\nHi Apple,\n\n \n\nMy condolences on the loss of a Great man he will be sorely missed in\nall areas of the Apple world.\n\n \n\nWhen someone dies that has changed, so fundamentally, the way we go\nabout our daily lives \n\nand the way we interact with each other then we have lost a true\nvisionary and a inventive genius.\n\n \n\nI have been an Apple devotee since the days of Apple IIc and have always\nloved the products ease of operation.\n\nI now own several of Apples products and will always do so. I believe\nSteve says \"It Just Works\" and that is so true.\n\n \n\nSo, good bye Steve you will always be looking over your \"baby\" and\nguiding continually its progress.\n\n \n\nRIP Steve Jobs...\n\n \n\nA great Man.. A Great Life well lived... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;","header":"RIP Steve.","author":"Dean","location":"from Australia"}
