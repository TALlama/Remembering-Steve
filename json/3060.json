{"mainText":"Dearest Apple,\n\nWords cannot adequately express the sorrow I feel in losing Steve Jobs.  He was not only a visionary, he was a good person.  He brought hope and happiness through technology to everyone from babies &amp; toddlers to grandparents.  He gave everyone life and part of him will live within each of us.  \n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with his family and his apple family.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Samantha","location":""}
