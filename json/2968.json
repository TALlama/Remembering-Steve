{"mainText":"I am sorry to hear of your loss.  Steve was a man who had great vision.  Thanks to him my world is a better more connected place.\n\nMy combo of Mac Book Pro, iPhone and iPad keep me in touch with my children and grandchildren who live far from me.\n\n With the devices Steve pioneered I can not only hear them but I can see them, live and in action. That means a lot to me.\n\nThank you for all you have done and may you rest pain free and in peace now.","header":"My Condolences to the Family of Mr. Jobs","author":"Tamara","location":""}
