{"mainText":"Steve, THANK YOU!!!!! from the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU!!!! Thank \nyou for teaching me that there are no limits to inspiration, and \nteaching me to live beyond set limits and realize there are no \nboundaries. In having a dream of how you can affect the world. But most \nof all  thank you for teaching me to have the faith to look back and \nconnect the dots, and learning to trust the future will do it all by \nitself. A Leader and a Visionary, a man whom we should all aspire to be \nlike, you will be missed by many, you will be missed by me, but the \nlegacy you leave behind, to follow your dreams will live on forever, \ninspiring people till the end of time. Rest Well, till we meet again.","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Kelley","location":""}
