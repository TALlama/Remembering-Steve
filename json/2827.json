Quite the quandary, especially if the life's work of the departed has a profound impact on your daily life.\n\nNevertheless, I am compelled to show my appreciation for all of the sacrifices, heartaches, and obstacles that Mr. Jobs undoubtedly encountered during his quest to make the world a better place.  His remarkable vision and uncompromising standards served him well during his journey, and he certainly succeeded in bestowing more upon mankind than he could ever receive.\n\nI would like to offer my condolences to all those who were fortunate enough to share time with Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;","header":"The Goodbye Quandary","author":"Dana","location":""}
