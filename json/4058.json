{"mainText":"We have lost a genius, a revolutionary man. Steve was the greatest\nvisionary the world had. Now, the world has lost him. With him, we were one step closer. Now, with his death, we have taken that\nstep back. Steve Jobs was not only a person, but the representation of a whole idea:\noriginality and perfection. Something most of us are far from achieving.Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. Your ideal will not be forgotten.Alberto, in tribute to Steve Paul Jobs (1955-2011).&nbsp;","header":"","author":"Alberto","location":""}
