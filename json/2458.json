{"mainText":"I am a 17 year old from India. I did not know Steve personally, and to be\nfrank I became aware of him only when he released the iPod. However since\nthen, Steven Paul Jobs has become the man I idolize, my guru, my role model,\nmy Hero. Every time someone I know even tries to make an anti-Apple or\nAnti-Steve Jobs statement I'm automatically there to defend the greatest\ncompany and the greatest innovator. For me Steve was like a God. Every time\nhe stepped onto the stage to make a keynote and release a product,\neverything else could wait, Steve was speaking.\nSure, I never knew him personally, but I could feel a connection with him\nbecause I knew him so well from all the books and speeches, and I'm sure he\nknew me too because the moment I needed something like a new phone, or a\ntablet, he went and made one, not just any product, he made the best\npossible.\nIf I go on I can write for hours, because in my eyes it is about the\ngreatest man that lived.\n\nR.I.P Steve\n","header":"My Hero","author":"Pranav","location":"from India"}
