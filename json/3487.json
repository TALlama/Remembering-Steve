{"mainText":"The world of technology has lost an absolute masterpiece of a genius. A man that is truly the definition of forward-thinking. His ambition, his passion for success and the human heart will forever be missed. A man that taught us that the only way a product could become successful is to merge technology and the liberal arts. Where the immersion of technology becomes magical and truly enriches lives. This day will forever be remembered as the day technology stood still and watched it's leader leave us. Leaves us a legacy to build upon, a vision to continually pursue and give others the opportunity to be great. I believe in his vision. I believe in his spirit. I believe in Apple.\n\nWe'll miss you Steve. You'll forever be remembered.&nbsp;","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Victor","location":""}
