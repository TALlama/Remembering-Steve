{"mainText":"I can remember the day I got my blue iPod Mini seven years ago in the \nsixth grade.  It was the coolest thing that I owned at the time, and I \nhave been a die-hard fan of all Apple products ever since.  The moment I \nfound out that Mr. Jobs passed away today, I felt much discomfort and \nsadness of my well being because this man is the reason why I have such \nan obsession with technology and how much we can learn from it.  I will \nalways remember Mr. Jobs as the man who came up with a product that \ninspired me to explore and stay connected to the ever changing world of \ntechnology.  I send my best to his family and friends, for I feel like I \nlost an idol and hero.","header":"Requiat in Pacem","author":"Phillip","location":""}
