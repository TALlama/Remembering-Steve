{"mainText":"Steve Jobs has honestly influenced my life so much. I'm proud to say I'm \nemailing this message right now on my Macbook Pro, with my iTouch, iPod \nNano, and Macbook are close by. It took one man to change technology \nforever. He made such an impact on every customer, always with pleasing \nproducts. I remember how upset I was after hearing he had resigned from \nhis position, only to find out months later, he had passed away. He was \na great man with a talent and passion for technology like no other.&nbsp;","header":"Remembering Steve Jobs","author":"Sami","location":""}
