{"mainText":"\n\n\n\nSo sad and sorry for the loss of Steve Jobs. A magnificent human being, a man that worked every day to see his dreams come true, a man that not only gave us amazing technology, but gave us a daily remembering of the things that we can do if we have faith, and if we work hard for what we want. He was a genius, a person that will be remembered forever, a very important part of the history of humanity. I know for sure that he is resting in peace now, and he is happy. We will meet you on the other side, Steve. Thank you for everything.","header":"Dear Steve","author":"Carolina and Daniel","location":"from Mexico City"}
