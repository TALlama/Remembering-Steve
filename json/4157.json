I am just one of those people who's\nfirst computer was an Apple II and have been a follower of Steve for all these many years.\nI doubt anyone will even seen this post.\n\nBut if ever there was someone to admire in this country, it was Steve Jobs.\nHe had a vision. He insisted on doing things right. He followed his dreams and both\nfailed and succeeded.\n\nI never met Steve, but I personally feel a great loss.  I want to thank Steve for the effect he has made\non my life (and many others) without even realizing it.\n\nSteve was not just a businessman. Not just a visionary. Not just a dreamer.\nHe wanted to make a mark on our worlds, and he did. He made our lives better.\n\nGod Bless you Steve Jobs. &nbsp; &nbsp;","header":"A loss for us all","author":"Paul","location":"from Florida"}
