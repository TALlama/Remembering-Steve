{"mainText":"In 1986, I wrote my thesis on a Mac and printed it on a Mac laser printer. As\nfar as I know I was the first one at Cornell to do so. It caused quite a\nruckus.  That machine taught me that good computers made you feel smart and\nempowered. They were tools that enabled greatness. I type this note on my\nbrand new Macbook Pro.  I just received it yesterday.\n\nThank you Steve.  Thank you for making machines that were not merely\nfunctional.  Thank you for making machines that featured stunning usability.\nThe tools of greatness.\n\nGodspeed sir. You will be missed.","header":"Remembrance","author":"Doug","location":""}
