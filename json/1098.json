{"mainText":"R.I.P. Steve Jobs \"We don¹t get a chance to do that many things, and everyone should be\nreally excellent. Because this is our life, life is brief, and then you die,\nyou know?\" ­ (Steve Jobs). Steve dies, this makes me amazingly sad, even some tears appear in my eyes,\nbut Apple, never forget, it was his lifework and should be forever his\nlifework. All of you  workers, managers, designers, really all of you who are responsible for the amazing products, made him a rich man. Not from\nthe financial point of view but from the social one. You all made him proud.\nYou have been a family. And you will be forever.\nNever forget his illusion and always work hard, to continue his lifework.\n\nA little of us lost a father, a husband\nSome of us lost a friend\nMany of us lost a director\nBut the most of us lost an idol, me too.\n\nWe will never forget him\nSincere condolences! All the best to all of you, keep your head up!\n\n\n\n\n","header":"Thank You, Steve","author":"Michael","location":""}
