{"mainText":"I consider myself to be a big fan of Steve Jobs. I am only a teen but have been a fan since 6th grade when I got my first Apple product, the 3rd generation black 8GB iPod Nano. I even wrote an essay about him in 7th grade when my teacher told the class to write about someone we look up to. This was and still is my favorite essay. Today I am in high school and hoping to work at an Apple Store sometime next year. This day was raining and I was reading all\n about the iPhone 4S when I went to the Apple homepage and saw Steve Jobs. I\n then felt like I had just been shocked with thousands of bolts of lightning. I started having tears run down through my eyes while writing this realizing that I will never get to meet Steve Jobs in this world. It makes me very sad but I realize that he is still here alive and well. He is here through iPods and iPhones, iPads  and Macs, Pixar and Apple. I realize that these things would not be possible without him, for there is only one Steve Jobs.","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
