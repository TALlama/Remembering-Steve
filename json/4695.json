{"mainText":"Steve Jobs knew people. He knew how to learn about them, their dislikes and habits. He also knew how to identify things that people wanted (before they knew themselves). And most importantly, he knew how to teach people what they wanted and (eventually) needed. I've watched Steve's Stanford Commencement Address many times, and each time I come away with something new that I only hope to instill in my two young children some day. As I look at their faces and think about what challenges they will face in their worlds, I find comfort in three ideals:  the hunger to learn, the courage to explore and the risk in trying  - much like Steve wished for those graduates that sunny day in 2005.\n\nMay God bless Steve, his family and his friends at Apple.\n\n\nThank you.\n\n","header":"THE Game Changer","author":"Lourdes","location":"from Philadelphia"}
