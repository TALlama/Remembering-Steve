{"mainText":"Thank you is a very simple basic response to a  kindness one does for you. \nThe magnitude of the contributions of Steve's talent,  genius, vision and \ngenuine desire to deliver the dreams of the future in the  here and now is a \ntestament to the legacy he leaves.\n    I personally learned how to use a computer on an  Apple II in 1996. I cannot  now or ever be \nable to complete a list of all the things I am now able to do  because of \nwhat Steve Jobs gave to mankind through his genius. \n    So from all of mankind, I am sure they would in the  over 150 languages \nspoken in this world join me and say...Thank You.\n    To his family and colleagues, may his memory be a  blessing to you all \nand may you only join again for happy occasions.&nbsp;","header":"Thank you","author":"Gershon","location":"from Boca Raton, Florida"}
