{"mainText":"I can't believe it.  I just logged in and saw Steve Jobs' picture and  \nthe date on the Apple home page.  I was confused at first because I  \nhadn't heard anything on the news.  Then I clicked on the picture and  \nI am saddened to learn of his passing.  I love my Apple products and I  \nwill miss Mr. Jobs and his amazing inventions of the future.","header":"With Sincere Sympathy","author":"Stephanie","location":""}
