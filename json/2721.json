{"mainText":"I was a total PC fan, and never understood Apple fans. Reading a bit \nabout what Steve was doing to Apple two years ago, I thought to myself \n\"There must be something I am missing, and as a teacher I need to \nunderstand why some people are so fond of these machines\". And it \nstarted with an offer for an iMac. The seller told me \"Once you start with this, there is no return. You \nwill not want to go back to a PC\". How right he was!\nI am now mainly using Apple, only turning to a PC notebook due to me \nteaching in that environment. Sad to have missed so many years of what \nSteve had been producing together with all you Apple people.\n\nHe will certainly be missed, but definitly not forgotten. His legacy is \nwith you people. Make him proud.\n\nWIth my deepest sympathy to all the Jobs family and the Apple family","header":"What Steve did for me","author":"Andres","location":""}
