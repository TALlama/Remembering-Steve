{"mainText":"To Apple,\nSteve Jobs has always been an inspiration to me as I progressed through \nschool, and even more recently as I've graduated and had to start \nthinking about what I'll do with my life. Jobs' success after not \ncompleting college, starting his own business from humble beginnings in \na garage and taking the world by storm has shown me that you don't need \nto be a part of a system to succeed and that one's character and \nperseverance will cause you to be admired and loved by everyone. Steve \nJob's story and life has taught me to be steadfast and passionate about \nwhat I do, excel in my strengths and improve on my weaknesses.\nThank you so much for introducing me to a true role model.","header":"Of Passion and Perserverance","author":"Dan","location":"from Sydney, Australia"}
