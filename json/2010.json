{"mainText":"Thank you Steve not only for what you did for this world but personally for\nme.  I began using Apple computers in graduate school and continued today in\nmy consulting business.  I have been poked fun and not considered a serious\nbusiness person due to use of MacBooks in my business.  I guess I got the\nlast laugh as I repeatedly told all that you can have wintels and apple is\nand will always be my computing source.  God bless Steve Job and thank you\nfor being such an influence in my life.  May Steve's legacy ALWAYS be\nretained in every product designed &amp; produced by Apple.  Steve Jobs is and\nalways will be Apple. ","header":"He touched my academic &amp; professional life","author":"Bobby","location":""}
