{"mainText":"Steve,\nI cannot take in what is going on right now. You were a visionary, a \nmastermind, and most of all, a great human being. Looking back on what \nyou provided the world and invented for all to experience is nothing \nshort of perfect. You were my role model, the person I looked up to, and \nI find it so hard to realize that you are gone. It makes me so sad to \nknow that I will never see you unveil new products anymore. Your \nkeynotes and ideas always inspired and amazed me. I'm sure you are in a \nbetter place now. Please Rest In Peace Steve. My thoughts and \ncondolences go out to your loved ones, friends, and colleagues. You gave \nme so much and I am truly greatful for that. I wish it could all be \ntaken back. You are amazing. I will miss you more than ever. Thank you Steve.","header":"Rest In Peace Steve","author":"Victor","location":"from Toronto"}
