For showing others the value of taking risks\nand the proper way to accept failure, and, pick up and keep moving forward.\n For leading, mentoring and generally cajoling a whole generation of geeks,\nnerds and 'fanbois' and making us all part of something bigger than we could\nhave ever imagined.\n\nWe'll miss you, your entertaining and demanding style and your relentless\ndrive and motivation.  The mold was indeed broken after you were cast and\nwe're all at least a little bit better for having had the opportunity to\nexist in your presence.&nbsp;","header":"Thanks","author":"Mark","location":""}
