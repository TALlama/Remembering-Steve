{"mainText":"One of my goals in life was to meet Steve Jobs in person and learn about \nhis vision and great achievements. Unfortunately that goal cannot be \ncompleted now because of his passing. He was a great visionary, \ninspirational figure, and a great CEO. I actually think he did make a \ndent in the Universe with bringing his intelligent ideas to life. I can \nsay that another goal I had was to be hired by Apple and fortunately \nthat has been accomplished recently. It was great working for Steve \nJobs. He will never be forgotten. I will always miss and remember him. \nOne day, when it's my time, I will hopefully be able to meet this man in \nthe next life.&nbsp;","header":"Steve Will Always be Remembered","author":"Jason","location":"from San Francisco, CA"}
