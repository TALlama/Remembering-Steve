{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was a great man, not only for his ability to SELL great products,\nbut for his ability to CREATE them. Not just imagine them, but to bring them\nto real life. What was truly great about what he did was not on the\npresentation stage, but in the board room and in the labs and in the\noffices. He had a vision for how a world class organization is run, for what\na world class organization DOES, and he had an uncanny ability to get\neveryone to buy into it and achieve that goal. In this way, he was not only\na business leader but an icon for modern humanity: we will need more people\nlike him in our future. He will be sorely missed. &nbsp;","header":"About Steve Jobs","author":"Ashish","location":""}
