{"mainText":"Thank you Steve for creating a culture of excellence at Apple and for never compromising on the details. Apple was our creative agency's client in the nineties. It was an extraordinary era when you re-built the company and executed your vision -- iTools, Tunes, iPhone -- and I got to be part of it in a very small way. Since then I've taken what I've learned at Apple in terms of standards and discipline, to two companies and enjoyed an exciting ride. Its been hard to reproduce what I experienced at Apple. I am just glad to have been working under your visionary leadership and to have had a part in your history in my small, modest way. You will be missed and what you taught me will remain stamped in my dna for the rest of my career and life.&nbsp;","header":"thank you","author":"Jennifer","location":""}
