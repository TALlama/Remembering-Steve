{"mainText":"Someone on NPR rightly called Steve the Thomas Edison of our age.  They \nalso said, he was unparalleled as an innovator and without peers.\nI certainly agree.  And there was something about his spirit, - the \nplayful, excitement that showed up when he launched his 'babies.'   An \namazing man.\nHe is a model for how to imagine outside of the box every day,.... in so \nmany lovely ways.  He will be missed, as our world does not see the \nbrilliance of a creator shine so  brightly so unmistakably. ","header":"Edison","author":"Douglas","location":""}
