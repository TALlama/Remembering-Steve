{"mainText":"Steve was indeed a visionary.  Its rare to see someone master their craft\nwith the same finesse as Steve.  Some compare him to Edison, I would compare\nhim to Einstein.  The man was more than a visionary, he was a pioneer,\nexecutioner and simply put, a genius who has changed the world in ways we\nhave yet to discover.  Its rare to see a fellow technologist receive the\nNobel Piece award for their contributions but I think he is long overdue and\nif IÂ¹m ever asked, he has my vote.\n\nGod Bless  you Steve.&nbsp;","header":"With sincere condolences","author":"Bryan","location":""}
