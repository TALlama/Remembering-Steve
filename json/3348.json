{"mainText":"I am an artist and musician embroiled in technology, a state I embrace. I\ndoubt that it would have happened without Mr. Jobs and his design-centric\ndevices. I was acquainted with computers early on, but from the moment I\ndiscovered a computer that could accept the sweeping movement of my hand\ninstead of the punching of a button or the toggling of a switch to control\nit and tell it what I wanted it to do, I was hooked. Being able to actually\nmanipulate the {now it seems so archaic} pixels that could form an image on\nthe screen so easily was technology I had only dreamed of, like something\nfrom a Jules Verne novel. And then so much more came. Music, high resolution\nart, motion imaging, and so fast.\n\nI thank you, Steve, for your dreaming, and perseverance. You have enriched\nmy life, and the lives of those whom touch mine. ","header":"Remembering his gifts","author":"Gordon","location":"from <br>"}
