{"mainText":"Dear Madam/Sir,\n\n \n\nIt is my strongest belief that there are\n\nno proper words that can offer relief\n\nto a person when they lose someone\n\nthey love. I lost my dear father when\n\nI was 25 years old, so, I know the\n\nfeeling.\n\n \n\nHowever, I strongly believe that the\n\nperson who passed away would not\n\nwant to cause sorrow to those he \n\nleft behind. Sadness may bring\n\ndown a person's imagination and\n\ncreativity. But that is not something\n\nthat Steve Jobs would want, neither\n\nfor his family, nor for his company's \n\npersonnel.!\n\n \n\nA true visionary, a true computer\n\ngenius, a man with his original approach\n\nto thinking. Even though I never got\n\nthe chance to meet him in person, I \n\nknow some things about him through\n\nhis creations. His last speech in the\n\ncommencement at Stanford was a \n\nrevelation. \n\n \n\nI offer my condolences to his family,\n\nand wish them the best for their\n\nfuture. May God rest his soul.&nbsp;","header":"Remebering Steve Jobs...!","author":"Theodoros","location":""}
