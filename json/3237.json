{"mainText":"With the passing of Steve Jobs, The world has lost not just a  \nvisionary, but a true humanitarian.  Steve Jobs inspired people as a  \ndeveloper and creator of hardware and software, to develop their own  \nproducts and businesses. Through products like HyperCard, AppleWorks,  \nQuicktime, and other products, he allowed users to become inventors.  \nThrough his Disability Solution Staff Project, he gave Disabled  \nindividuals a great\nopportunity to be equal via technology and made the world a better  \nplace for everyone.\n\n\nMy thoughts and prayers are with the Jobs Family as we all mourn the  \nloss of this great human being.","header":"Remembering Steve Jobs","author":"John","location":""}
