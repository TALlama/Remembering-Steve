{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was the person who I knew during my time in high school in\nJapan, and has inspired me in many, many ways with unfathomable depth\nand gravity.\n\nHis speech at Stanford University was the one that encouraged me most\nto study hard and keep advancing. My first encounter with his speech\nwas in my favourite English teacher's class, and it seemed firstly not\nreally interesting. The more I listened to it, however, the more I was\nenchanted and inspired to my backbone. I'm pretty sure I was the one\nthat liked and admired Steve most in my class, and I even now continue\nto listen to his legendary speech as a part of my study of English and\nthe lifelong memorable quote ever in my life. \"Stay Hungry, Stay\nFoolish.\"\n\nAs I enrolled in Waseda University and started anew, I gradually\nforgot the quote. I got tied up with my works and I was about to lose\nmy goals and motives, which was of course created by the quote.\nNotwithstanding, I now have realized again why I struggled hard to\nenter the university and what I wanted to do in my life, just like\nSteve wanted students of Stanford to be, and my teacher wanted me to\nbe.\n\nSteve's death did make me cry. I haven't experienced this kind of\nsadness in the last 18 years I have lived. He was too great to die and\nto leave the world behind. I shall never forget Steve and his spirit. I appreciate what \"Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish\" means and what I am\nsupposed to learn and what I will do.\n\nMy great thanks to Apple that gave me the opportunity to present my\nfeelings and I would like to extend my heartfelt condolences for the\nloss of the legendary man in the history of mankind.\n\nRIP for Steven Paul Jobs, \"Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish\" forever.&nbsp;","header":"","author":"Wataru","location":"from Tokyo, Japan"}
