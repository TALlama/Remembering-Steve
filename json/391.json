{"mainText":"I had the great fortune of working for Apple retail for a short period of time. It was the best company I have ever worked for, and was always thrilled when I would receive a company broadcast email from Steve as part of the \"team.\" My wife and daughters can name no other CEO in any company other than Steve. I made sure of that, and they have fallen in line as being Apple fans as well. It's all because of what Steve and the incredible team at Apple have\n put together. We will certainly miss Steve and his legacy. Thanks for every\nthing.&nbsp;","header":"See you in the iClouds Steve","author":"Tom","location":"from Alpharetta, Georgia"}
