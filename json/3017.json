{"mainText":"I have never met Steve but i have grown up with his technology. When i was six i had a mac in my house. When I was nine i got my first ipod, at eleven i had an ipod nano.Today i have a MacBook Pro. His inventions have changed technology in so many ways. He is a genius who deserves honor and respect for all the great things he has done in his life. No one has had such a large influence in our world. Steve Jobs is an incredible man who will be missed in my heart and in the hearts of everyone else in the world. To him i say thanks for showing everyone that anything is possible.\n","header":"","author":"Annalicia","location":""}
