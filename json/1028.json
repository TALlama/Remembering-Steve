{"mainText":"I am 49 years old and remember when home computers were little more  \nthan glorified word processors. I have been on this amazing journey  \nbrought to us by Steve Jobs. Steve changed all of our lives. Why?  \nBecause he wanted everyone to benefit from Apple's greatness. He  \nmarginalized no one. He didn't want to reach only a younger  \ndemographic, or an older one. His vision was for ALL of us.\n\nI know Apple will continue to make great products but I sure would  \nhave liked to spend the next few decades enjoying the fruits of his  \ngreat vision. So sorry he's gone so soon.&nbsp;","header":"Thank you","author":"Kimberly","location":""}
