{"mainText":"I never actually met Steve Jobs, but used to run into him in Palo Alto when we lived near his home. Once, waiting to cross the street at a light, I looked up and there he was, a couple feet away. I recognized him but didn't want to bother him. I was excited and in my head I was saying, \"Hey Steve! I love what you do\", but I just smiled. He smiled back a warm smile, the crosswalk light turned green and we went on about our way. It was my little brush with greatness. \n\nI've been a fan from the early days of the Mac, and while I'm sad about his passing, I'm thrilled that he did what he did that affects so many lives in such cool and amazing ways. For that, I'm forever grateful for Steve Jobs.","header":"Sad Day, Amazing Guy","author":"Bill","location":""}
