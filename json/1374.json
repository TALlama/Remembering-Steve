{"mainText":"I remember the Apple IIe. Just starting High School, and taking this crazy computer class, I knew \nthat Apple was on to something. About a 2 dozen Apple desktops, laptops, ipods, iTouchs, and soon to be \nmy first iPhone later, I can only say thank you to Steve for all he did.\n\nHis journey; success, failure, and then greater success, has been a \nguiding example to how I have lived my life.\n\nNever afraid to tell us what we want, he did it his own way, and has \ninspired the NeXT generation of human digital harmony....\n\n\tat least I hope so.\n\nMy condolences to all of you at Apple, you will miss him, but I am sure \nthat his spirit will guide your continued innovation.\n\nThank You Steve!\n\nand Thank you Apple!","header":"Where would we be today without Apple?","author":"Antony","location":""}
