{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\n\nJust this morning, before the news of your passing was announced, I read an article in my local paper.\nIt mentioned an experiment that was conducted on children as young as 14 months. The children were given various mobile phones of different brands.\nIt was noted that almost immediately, the child would make a swiping gesture on the screen of the phone, thinking the device was an iPhone &amp; expecting it to come to life.\n\nSuch is the impact of the iPhone. You have really changed the way we work, play &amp; live.\n\nYou will always be remembered, Steve.","header":"you changed the way we work play &amp; live","author":"Shella","location":""}
