{"mainText":"As a young college graduate in the 80s, it was always a competition - Apple\nvs IBM, I remember those days fondly. One of the first 10 people in my\ncompany to get a personal computer. I chose an IBM PC but others chose\nApple.  Those on both sides had a certain awe and mystique about the \"other\"\nmachines.  I put an Apple sticker on my PC just so I could like like one of\nthe cool people.  On the outside, I wore a suit, but my inner soul was jeans\nand tee shirts.  I am so sad that Steve Jobs is gone.  The world will be a\nless colorful place.\n","header":"He Touched My Life in So Many Ways","author":"Elizabeth","location":""}
