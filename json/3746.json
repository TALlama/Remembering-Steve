{"mainText":"The physical world has lost Steve Jobs, the \"tech\" John Lennon. As \ninspiring and revolutionary as Lennon, Jobs was also centered, \ninnovative, creative and communicative, and gave us the gift of \nsimplistic connectivity just as Lennon gave us the gift of poetic \npeace-driven verse. The spiritual world has gained a new member this \nevening, one who will live each moment fondly, chasing love and passion \nto infinity and beyond.\n\nThank you for sharing your words during your 2005 Stanford speech. I, \nlike millions, have watched it countless times on YouTube and took your \nmessage to heart. It has impacted my life for the better.","header":"The physical world has lost Steve Jobs, the \"tech\" John Lennon","author":"Kristopher","location":"from Austin, Texas"}
