{"mainText":"Hello, although I do not know Steve Jobs personally I would like to express my sincere condolences. Apple and Steve have deeply touched my life and how I live in it. Ever since my first Mac I became fascinated with the company and would from then on watch every keynote. I would love to watch Steve's passion, excitement, and love for his work. It really showed. I want to let you know that Steve Jobs is in my thoughts and prayers and hope the best for Apple.","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Reynaldo","location":""}
