{"mainText":"Just wanted to say how amazing of a person i thought he was. He was a huge influence in our lives and of all the lives to come. I wish i could say more that would really encompass how i feel about his passing. I noticed on facebook the hundreds of my friends who had posted sad status's related to him and i thought that instead of also posting something mournful i would celebrate his life so i said \"Im sure heaven is decked out with YOUR stuff so everyone can continue to enjoy the amazing product you've given us\"\n\ntotally meant it. words dont do him justice. just like the tingly feeling you get from watching an apple commercial...there is\nno word to convey the feelings of respect, admiration, and love. \n\nMay he rest in a delightfully happy and fulfilled peace.","header":"He will never be forgotten","author":"Kian","location":""}
