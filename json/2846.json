{"mainText":"TRIBUTE TO STEVE JOBS\n\nMe and my husband would like to express our deepest condolences to Steve Jobs family, friends and the whole team of Apple.\n\nWe are very sadden to hear about his passing, as he is someone we both admire so very much.\n\nHe always impressed me with his creativity, genius, organizational skills, and most importantly - ETHICS AND INTEGRITY.  \n\nSteve Jobs always stood out as a visionary, who would not succumb to the lower standards of todays society, where so much is driven by profit only, but always maintained a high level of ethics and integrity in the direction he was taking APPLE. \n\nI LOVE every APPLE product I own, it worth every penny I paid and more, because it was a dream, a vision, that was made into a reality and then shared with me! That's rare!! And that is very much appreciated! \n\nI feel as if I lost a dear friend. I wish Steve all the best in his new journey and look forward to see new incredible things from one of the most amazing beings on this planet!!!&nbsp;","header":"TRIBUTE TO STEVE JOBS - amazing visionary and artist!","author":"Maria","location":""}
