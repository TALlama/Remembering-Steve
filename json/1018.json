{"mainText":"When Mr. Jobs stepped down from the CEO position at Apple a short time  \nago, I happily read in the many articles about his life and legacy  \nthat his was not a path of a virtuoso academic, but the path of an  \nartist. I saw in his life a light to guide my own, as I am in a  \nsimilar place to where he once was. I am freshly 26 years old and have  \nspent time traveling and learning and have not yet found my place, but  \nhave known that my place is not in the Ivy League or the cubicle. I  \nhear Steve's words: Follow Your Heart. Find What You Want to Do. You  \nAre Already Naked, Don't Be Afraid. I am truly moved by these thoughts  \nand by Steve's manifestation of these words. They were not just  \ndistant philosophy, they were practicable and accomplishable. I am not  \nafraid to seek out and build my own destiny. I am more strongly  \nfocused and more sure of my path and my future triumph. And I thank  \nSteve Jobs for this.\n","header":"Steve's path","author":"Anthony","location":""}
