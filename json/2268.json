{"mainText":"Steve Jobs improved many moments in my life.  I found out my wife was pregnant over a video iChat while I was away for an extended work trip. I FaceTime with my kids very day when I'm at work. There's an endless list of life moments his vision has made possible for me personally. A great man who was not out to make money but to change the world for the better. The world needs more like Steve Jobs.","header":"Thank you Steve","author":"Eric&nbsp;","location":""}
