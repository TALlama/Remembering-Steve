{"mainText":"Dear Apple, It is very sad to know that such a genius had left us. He has always been my\n hero, my role model. His words have always been inspiring. 'Stay hungry, stay foolish' has become my motto in life, get me to reflect and be true to my\nself. Even though he can no longer be with us, he had lived a legend and the whole\n world is lamenting. I really hope Apple could carry on his passion, and do the best that you can to carve out another legend just like him, for he had already built a foundation for you to get going. Wish you all the best and stay tough! I am an Apple fan and will stay tune on your products.","header":"Steve Jobs is a hero","author":"Anita","location":""}
