{"mainText":"Dear Steve:\nI'm going to miss you a lot.\nI'm just a teenage girl in high school right now, but trust me when I say\nthat you've changed my life without even knowing it. Because of you, I've\nhad the courage to defy my family and tell them that I'm going to make a\ncareer out of animation, even though that's not the \"practical route\"\nthey've wanted me to take.\nThrough your struggles and success, I want to try so much harder to overcome\nmy own hardships, and I promise one day, because of your influence on me,\nthat I will be successful.\nYou were a great man.","header":"","author":"Michelle","location":""}
