{"mainText":"I am so sorry for the loss of Steve Jobs. I was on the Apple website looking at the new iPhone 4s, when I went back to the main page and saw the picture of Steve. It may seem strange but I started to cry. I never knew Steve Jobs personally, but I looked forward to everyone one of his Keynote speeches and set reminders for when they would be on, so I could get excited about my next Apple purchase. We spend hours as a family in the Apple Stores, because it just feels like home. Steve was a brilliant man and so excited about his work! Not many people get to go to work each day and be that excited and proud of what you do for work.&nbsp;\n\nTo the Apple Team - know that Steve is still with each of you and he will be watching to see what great products you come up with in the future.\n\nMake Steve proud!","header":"RIP Steve","author":"Corrina","location":""}
