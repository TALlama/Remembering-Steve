{"mainText":"Dear Apple,\n                      I can remember the first time I saw my first macintosh\nin person was when  i was being  shown around my prospective secondary\nschool, they had nine macs, it was 1985, I knew i had to go this school\nbecause it must be some kind of super school if it had nine macs. They were\nso beautiful and i remember the sense of wonder when i first used them.\n                   I am so sad at the loss of Steve Jobs, I just to offer\nmy condolences to his family, friends and colleagues, I have loved Apple\nmacs for twenty seven years, I was so happy when he came back in 1996 to\nguide Apple back from the brink and was happy and thrilled at all the\nsuccess that Steve and everybody at Apple has achieved. I will miss the\nKeynotes and product introduction and of course, the one more thing. It\nwill never be the same again.&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs- Thanks for everything.","author":"Sanje","location":""}
