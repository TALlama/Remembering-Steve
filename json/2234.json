{"mainText":"Dear Apple,\n\nI want to take a moment to remember and celebrate the life of the genius\nthat Steve Jobs was.\n\nSteve. You single handedly changed the way the world and how I interacted and\nconsumed media. You converted me from a PC enthusiast to a Mac devotee. You\ncreated products of utmost beauty and simplicity. Who knows what else you\nwould have invented had you lived on.\n\nThe world will never be the same without your pursuit of perfection. Nobody\nwill ever replace you. May you rest in peace and may your legacy live on for\ngenerations to come.\n\nI send my condolences to your family. I hope the world respects them while\nthey mourn their loss.\n\nRIP, Steve.","header":"Good Bye to the Genius that Revolutionized the World","author":"David","location":""}
