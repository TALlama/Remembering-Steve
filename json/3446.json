{"mainText":"I never knew Steve personally, and I always sort of imagined him as a somewhat Godlike figure; I had no idea what he did every day, had a vague picture of him in my head but no concrete one, and he seemed awesome, but I couldn't know for sure.

RIP Steve Jobs - the definer of a generation.\n","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
