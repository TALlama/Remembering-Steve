Can't imagine how a human becomes \nneurologically wired with the innovative mind that Steve Jobs employed. \nHopefully he would be pleased knowing that every Apple product in the \nhands of someone doing good and trying to better the human race is an \nextension of handiwork living on. You will be profoundly and sorely missed, Steve Jobs.","header":"Remember steve jobs","author":"David","location":""}
