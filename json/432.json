{"mainText":"\nDear Steve,\n\n      I would personally like to thank you, thank you for being creative and thinking outside of the box, your compassion for an art form that many did not quite comprehend gave us a portrait many could not begin to appreciate. You taught many to believe that with a little drive and a lot of heart you can make anything possible. Through that little bite in a an apple you will be remembered forever as a visionary, a humanitarian, but most of all a pure an utter genius!\n\n\nThank you Steve Jobs,\n\nYou will be missed.","header":"Thank You Steve...","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
