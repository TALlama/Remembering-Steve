{"mainText":"We are an Apple family and will be forever.  We have a 10 year old son who has low functioning Autism.  The iPad is now changing his life and it is being used at school everyday to teach him new things. He absolutely loves his iPad and we hope eventually it will be able to talk for him.  We will be forever grateful for Steve Jobs and his vision for the world.  We are sad tonight.  We are a middle class hard working family and he has changed the way we live. Prayers to his family.","header":"Steve","author":"The Woodring Family","location":""}
