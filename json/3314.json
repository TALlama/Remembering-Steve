{"mainText":"The greatest entrepreneur of the modern age has passed away. The man who co-founded Apple, the computer company which has now become one of the top valued companies on the planet. Then co-founded Pixar, a animation studio which has brought us into computer animated age, and brought us unparalleled quality films. To see him pass on is something I thought would happen in my late 30's when he was nearing his 70's...56, is too soon, the man beat cancer and came back and showed us signs of strength, signs he may have been acting all this time to keep us from worrying. The man literally, worked himself to death.\n\nI won't spend pages honoring his achievements, we know them all today when we pop in Toy Story, or boot up an app on our iPhone. Some of us will be typing and reblogging, tweeting, and sharing our posts about this man's legacy on our MacBooksall the while listening to music on our iPods. \n\nThe man brought us much, and he inspired me to apply to Reed College like he did, though I couldn't afford it and still couldn't.\n\nSo please everyone, honor this man, a man who ushered in the era of the modern smartphone, the man who made the GUI system something tangible, the man who gave us Finding Nemo. \n","header":"Honor him.","author":"Johnathan","location":""}
