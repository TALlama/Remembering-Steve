{"mainText":" I was going to email this to you a while ago but never did. When my baby girl was born last year we almost lost her. She stopped breathing after birth and didn't start again on her own until 12 hours later. It was a horrific situation. The doctors prepared us for a pretty grim outlook. While she was in the NICU I used my iPhone to document every event which was immediately uploaded to Facebook where all my family and friends from around the world watched and prayed. I never would have been able to do that without your vision for the iPhone. \n\nThanks Steve.&nbsp;","header":"Thanks Steve","author":"Marco","location":""}
