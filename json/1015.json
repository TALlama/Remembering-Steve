{"mainText":"Steve,\n\nThank you for the inspiration you have been to all of us. To never settle\nfor what we know, and to challenge ourselves with new ideas. I am an IT\nprofessional, and you single handedly changed my entire life. If it was not\nfor you, and a few other visionaries, I would not be in the profession I am\ntoday. Thank you for everything you did, and never settling for anything but\nthe best. I still to this day do not use your Macintosh computers, but must\nadmit that they are the most polished and innovative computers in the world.\nToday I am typing on this wonderful device called an iPad 2, and I use every\nproduct you make outside of Macintosh computers. That was your vision though\nwasn't it? To build a mobile world, and change conventional computing as we\nknow it. Thank you Steve Jobs; you will truly be missed by us all!&nbsp;","header":"Thank You!","author":"John","location":""}
