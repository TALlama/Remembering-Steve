{"mainText":"\n\nI don't know where to begin and how to begin. Dear all - I am so sorry. \nAs I'm writing this mail, I have tears in my eyes. Tears for a man I \nnever got to know - but owe so much. I will make it short: thank you, Steve, for being such a big Genius. \nThank you so much for all you did, all you created. For your passion, \nyour dedication, your way to enrich people's lives with your brilliant \nideas.\nWherever you are now, I hope you are happy... I am going to miss you, \nSteve.\n\nMy thoughts are with Steve's family and friends. Words cannot express \nthis horrible loss. But I hope he's now Apple's Guardian Angel.","header":"My deepest sympathies...","author":"Eva","location":"from Germany"}
