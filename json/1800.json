{"mainText":"I was 16 years old when I bought my first Apple II europlus. I was a \nvery bad student. My first computer triggered the desire to learn and I \nstarted an engineering degree. Today I'm 50 and I never bought anything \nelse than Apple computers for the last 34 years and I had a successful \ncareer in a major Company. When my daughter was 2 years old she could \nalready used a mouse and therefore a Mac. Today she is 21 and of course \nan Apple fan.\n\nIt has been MAGIC since the first machine till today and the MAGIC is \neven more impressive machines after machines, OS after OS. iRevolution \nafter iRevolution!!!!\n\nOf course Apple will continue but tonight I'm sad.","header":"Thank you Steve.
