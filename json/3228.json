{"mainText":"Steve was the most remarkable soul I've ever seen in my life. He was stubborn, never settled for less, visionary, and brilliant. \n\nWhen I bought my first Mac, an iBook G4 in 2003, I was captivated not only by this machine's brilliance, but later, by the man who was the driving force behind it. I was an Apple faithful ever since. I love the products, the atmosphere, the soul, and it was all thanks to Steve's amazing imagination and perseverance. Steve Jobs is Apple, and vice versa. \n\nMy heart breaks for his wife and children, and all his loved ones, my deepest sympathies and comfort goes out to them. It is always tragic when someone still young and in their prime is taken away so suddenly. Perhaps it is even more heartbreaking when it is someone as original and wonderful as Steve. He fought hard all his life, for his company and his life. Such a soul is never forgotten, and it is to Apple's benefit and best interests to never do so. \n\nWe must remember Steve, for the brilliant Renaissance Man he is, and the bright, beautiful soul he was. \n\nWe love you, Steve. Long live your memories and long live the company you created. May your bright spirit forever remind us that the \"journey is the reward.\" \n","header":"I will miss you.","author":"Ruthie","location":""}
