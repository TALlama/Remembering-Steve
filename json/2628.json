{"mainText":"\nAs I look at the words on the screen about the death of Steve Jobs, it looks so stark and feels so cold.  Crayola should make a rainbow colored crayon and name the color Steve Jobs as his influence and products inspired so many people to become vibrant, expressive, warm, and overflowing with ideas.  I hope his spirit remains at the core of Apple forever.  My condolences to his family.","header":"Death of Steve","author":"Michelle","location":""}
