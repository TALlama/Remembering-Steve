{"mainText":"What can I say that has not already been said about Steve Jobs.\n\nI have been in the Computer industry since the 1980's and until about 5 \nyears ago have always been a PC guy.  After watching one of the product \nannouncements, I decided to try a MacBook Pro.  Wow! I wish I had seen \nthe value earlier.  Steve obviously saw the future in technology and \nwhat people wanted from technology long before anyone else and had a \npassion unlike anyone in this modern day for bringing innovative  \nproducts into the market place.\n\nI would place him along side Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell as \na \"visionary inventor\" that blessed all mankind with his creativity, \npassion, vision and drive for perfection.\n\nHe will be missed by us all for ever.\n\nMay God bless his family, friends and all those close to him.&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs - Visionary, Inventor and all around Good Guy.","author":"Howard","location":""}
