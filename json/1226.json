{"mainText":"I just wanted to say that as an 18 year old no one has inspired me more than Steve Jobs.  Mr. Jobs has inspired me, to always keep innovating, never say that's good enough, and even to go to school for IT and one day I hope to have the honor of working for Apple, the amazing company that Steve Jobs created. My thoughts and prayers to the Jobs family and Apple employees as we go through this difficult time. I would like us to remember Steve Jobs as a visionary who revolutionized the way we interact with our technology in a magical way. I wish you all the best.","header":"Remembering Steve Jobs","author":"Tyler","location":""}
