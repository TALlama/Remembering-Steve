{"mainText":"I didn't ever meet Steve, but I admired him as a visionary, an inspirer, and a storyteller.  Each day, for the past 3 years, I have looked at the two Steve quotes I have written on my white board:\n\n\"Do you want to make sugar water for the rest of your life or do you want to come with me and change the world?\"\n\n\"Stay hungry.  Stay foolish.\" - from his legendary Stanford Commencement address in 2005.\n\nThese words have inspired me to always be pursuing the things that ignite my passion in business and in life.  My deepest sympathies go to his family and all those who knew him and will dearly miss him.&nbsp;","header":"Steve was an inspiration to all","author":"Kevin","location":""}
