The impact of his work and passion has been felt by millions all over the planet, and that feeling was definitely a good one. Mr Jobs has made an even greater and more heartfelt influence in our daily lives than most politicians ever will. He has done so much for us, and we will always remember him.\n\nFrom myself and many more in Singapore, our deepest condolences are extended to his family and friends. His passing is also a great loss to the modern tech community; he is an irreplaceable genius.\n\nMay he rest in peace.&nbsp;","header":"He made the world a better place","author":"Anonymous","location":"from Singapore"}
