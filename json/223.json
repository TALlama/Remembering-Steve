{"mainText":"Our sincere condolences on the loss of your husband, father, and visionary leader.  My family has enjoyed the Apple vision since our first Mac Plus in 1988, which we still have and still works.  My son grew up with the user centric, user friendly Mac system that Steve was responsible for.  Steve shared with all of us a creative mind and vision that believed devices should be about enhancing life, not numbing our minds to blithering followership. He was never one to toot his own horn, the whole was always more important than the one. I am thankful we were able to benefit from the fruits of his vision. His zest for life was infectious.  May he rest in Peace. And may you find comfort knowing how much he was loved and appreciated by so many.  He made our world a much better place to live in.","header":"Our Condolences and rememberances","author":"Steven","location":""}
