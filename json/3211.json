{"mainText":"Steve jobs was a person I admired I constantly watch his forever amazing and\n iconic keynotes announcing the greatest products ever made. His commencement speech at Stanford it's something that reminds how life works and the key to succeed. Steve founded my most favorite animation film studios Pixar there\n isn't a single thing I don't like about Pixar and there is nothing I enjoyed more than watching their instant classic movies that will be with us forev\ner.\nHe is truly the Da Vinci of our time and in my opinion there isn't going to be someone like him in a very very long time because the greatest minds don't\n come so often and I think everyone agrees that Steve changed the world; he changed the way we think of computers, mobile devices and music. I always thought of him as the greatest speaker of all time and I would like to hear him\n again in an apple event.\nHe will always be my inspiration and his words will be in my way of thinking\n my entire life.\nMy regards to is family, close friends and at Apple and I hope you follow his thoughts of perfection to make more great products that the whole world is\n eager to see.\n\nThank You for your inspiration and Thank You for everything you've accomplished.\n","header":"A genius man","author":"Ariel","location":""}
