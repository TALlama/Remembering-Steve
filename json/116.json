{"mainText":"RIP Mr. Steve Jobs,\n\nI have never written a random letter like this but I just want to thank you\nfor being a great asset to this world. Especially, for bringing such\ninnovation in our technology. I have been in a long distance relationship with my fiancee. &nbsp;iPhone and Facetime has made everything soo much easier for us to communicate- it feels as if he was not even miles away! We are planning our wedding &nbsp;still apart from each other, but\nthanks to iPhone, wedding planning and preparations has been easier! You are\namazing, and I just want to thank you for your brilliant mind. May you rest\nin peace.&nbsp;","header":"RIP Mr. steve jobs","author":"Jamelyn","location":""}
