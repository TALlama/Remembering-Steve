{"mainText":"I remember my first Apple.  An Apple II+.  Then the Apple Iigs.  Then – wow – a Macintosh.  What a game changer.  I remember how different this little box was.  I loved Apple all through college.  Then law school.   Now I'm grown up.  Sort of.  I own a law firm.  And we use Apples.  Lawyers using Apples.  Really!  Steve Jobs was Apple.  And he was a visionary.  He was to computing what Van Gogh was to Art, or Shakespeare was to literature.  It's sad to lose a genius like Steve – but we are blessed to have lived in his shadow.\n","header":"","author":"John","location":""}
