{"mainText":"My heartfelt sympathy goes out to Steve's Family on this sad day. Everything\n I touch in my world today, has been effected by the creativeness of Steve Jobs. I owe him my thanks for all he has contributed to the World of technology. I shall miss his witty unveilings and most of all his down to Earth approach of addressing complexities. This has been the end of a great Era...or perhaps the beginning of a new one inspired by this great innovator. Part of my world has been made easier and more fun because of you Steve.","header":"Apple by Name","author":"Urtha","location":"from Chambersburg, PA"}
