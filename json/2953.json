{"mainText":"\n\n\n\nI saw the multi-colored Apple logo for the first time when I was just 10 years old back in 1995. The original iMac was such a revolutionary design &amp; utter beauty. iPod is one of the most important inventions of our generation. iPhone 3G S is the first ever Apple product I ever bought and I just LUV it. Can't wait to buy iPhone 4S, MacBook Pro &amp; anything innovative Apple puts out there. Jobs is no more but he immortalized himself by steering APPLE to what it is today. APPLE  Steve Jobs. He is still alive. Just look @ your iPhone. THANK YOU STEVE JOBS. I hope you're in a better place now. \t\t \t   \t\t  ","header":"Thank YOU Steve","author":"Shiraz","location":""}
