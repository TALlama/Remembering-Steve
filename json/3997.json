{"mainText":"Steve was a great creator of irresistible technologies - new kind of \npleasure - for people, who have creative thinking and who generate \nideas. He was the hard-worker that always inspired me with his thorough \napproach to   every detail in his project by polishing the results of \nhis research until they could shift everyone's expectation.\n\nIm just a user of Apple, but I feel proud to be a part of Apple's \nfamily.\n\nAnd I would like to thank Steve for the dream that he sold to me in a \nform of technology.\n\nI present my condolences to Steve's family and Apple Team.","header":"Thank you Steve for the world of opportunities.","author":"Karina","location":""}
