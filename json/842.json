{"mainText":"I'm twelve years old. The first time I actually heard of Steve Jobs was one year ago. It was when my dad showed me Steve Jobs' speech to the Stanford graduation class. I watched the speech and asked who that guy was. My dad replied, \"Steve Jobs\". At the time, I had just gotten my iPod Touch and absolutely worshiped it with all my life. When my dad replied that he was the founder of Apple, I screamed. I couldn't believe that I hadn't known this guy until now.&nbsp;\nNow that he has passed away, I think that this day will be one to go into the history books. \"The Founding of Apple\", the heading would say, and below that, \"The Man Behind the Magic: Steve Jobs\". This man will always be remembered for his great innovations.&nbsp;\n\nRIP Steve Jobs.","header":"RIP","author":"Amy","location":""}
