{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was one of my personal heroes. I am currently studying computer science in high school, and we often talk about him and his achievements in our classes. Steve really inspired me to follow cs, and his life story is remarkable. The world really needs more people like him, because he really was the da Vinci of our time. It's just so amazing how one man could think of such amazing devices, such as mac os, ios, ipod, itunes, iphone, and ipad. He really will be remembered, and will be in our thoughts and prayers.","header":"Amazing Man","author":"Sam","location":""}
