{"mainText":"So sad to say goodbye to someone who has changed our lives so much.  I  \nfirst came to know Apple products as a school teacher, and purchased  \nmy first home computer when the iMac was introduced.  With each new  \nApple product, Steve Jobs made the world more accessible, more  \nfascinating, and full of creative possibilities for all of us. His  \nunique vision and drive made us want to know more not only about his  \nproducts, but about him as well.   One can only wonder what more he  \nhad in store for us had he lived longer.\n\nA light goes out tonight, but it's glow remains with us and will for  \nyears to come.\n\n\n","header":"Remembering Steve Jobs","author":"Susan","location":""}
