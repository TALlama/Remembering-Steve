{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\n\nI have been a fan since I purchased my first computer, a Mac SE in my graduate school days. You have inspired our generation to follow our dreams and to make a difference in our world. You showed me faith, passion, courage, resilience, and perseverance as you created magic again and again in your pursuits.  I will miss you immensely. Thank you Steve.","header":"Goodbye Steve","author":"Ben&nbsp;","location":""}
