{"mainText":"I never met Steve but wished one day I would. Living a million miles away we think of you as our guide to the tech future, and admire your innovations. Millions will miss you and I know we will remember you each year. I know ill be telling my son about how I lived in the years Steve Jobs was around changing the world. May the angels be there for you and may god have a place in heaven for you. May god comfort your family through hard times and give them strength.","header":"","author":"Tarek","location":""}
