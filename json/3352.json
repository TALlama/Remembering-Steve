{"mainText":"My sincerest condolences on the lost of a visionary. Even though I personally have never met Mr Jobs, he has changed my perception of what a personal computer should be. His insight and dedication to us, the customer, has been felt so personal. His dreams of making things user friendly was unique and so appreciated. I hope that he has passed this on to his fellow Apple family, because its a touch that is surely missed.\n\nForever in our prayers.&nbsp;","header":"Lose is felt all over","author":"Gio","location":""}
