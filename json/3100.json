{"mainText":"I'm a graphic designer of the same generation as Chip Kidd--in commercial \nart school, we were the last to learn how to do pasteups, use a stat \ncamera, and master mysterious tools like ruling pens and phototypositors. \nWe were also the first to have the benefit of the amazing Macintosh (the \nClassic, maybe. My first was a IIcx) which instead of being a scary, \nimpersonal machine, was a friendly face that told us everything would be \nall right, that we could learn and create and dream.\n\n\nThank you, Steve Jobs, for being the best kind of designer and human being. \nAnd thank you Apple, for continuing in his legacy.","header":"condolences and gratitude","author":"Kim","location":"from Minneapolis, MN"}
