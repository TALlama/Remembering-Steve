Right from an iPod to a MacBook to the iPhone and to the iPad, I have looked up to how Mr. Jobs has\nchanged the world with his excellence.\n\nI'm only 18 and do not know much about Mr. jobs, but I do know that his inventions excited me and gave me a whole new look at the\ngizmo world. Apple changed my life. Mr jobs changed my life. He was the man I looked up to and wanted to be like. I will miss you very much Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;","header":"steve jobs i will miss you","author":"Vasudhaa&nbsp;","location":""}
