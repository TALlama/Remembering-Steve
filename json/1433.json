{"mainText":"I recently just bought my first Mac. It is a beautiful thing. On Facebook I\nsaw that Steve Jobs had passed, and people were posting his speech at\nStanford. I watched it, and cried as I mourned for someone I didn't know,\nbut who's genius I was using to watch the video. While I was crying, I was\nreflecting on what he said and trying to take it to heart. Steve Jobs\nadvocated for being your best self and loving what you do, and then showed\nus how through his tremendous life. The crying was brought on by the sadness\nhis family must feel, but also the joy of seeing how people a person's life\nreally can be, even if tragically cut short. I closed my computer and tried\nto concentrate on my school work, but couldn't get it off my mind. When I\nopened up my internet browser, the apple website popped up (my homepage),\nand I am so grateful for the opportunity to send my condolences. Thank you\nfor that. My thoughts are with him and his family and with Apple and Pixar\nand everything he touched.&nbsp;","header":"Thank You","author":"Shelby","location":"from Colorado State University"}
