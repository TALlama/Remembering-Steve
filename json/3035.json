{"mainText":"Dear Apple and the relatives of Steve Jobs,\nI am so sorry to hear of the loss of one of the greatest cultural heroes \nwe know of from the 20th century into the 21st century.   No one I feel \ncould ever replace him.  His vision of the future\nnever failed.   His ability to bring back Apple from the brink was \nnothing less than miraculous. I hope his spirit will live on in all that \nyou do, and give us a moment to reflect what\ntechnology would have been like had he not come back to Apple.    My \ncondolences to everyone there.    And remember, he fought for the best \nquality product out there.  Don't ever forget that.&nbsp;","header":"Thinking of Steve","author":"Abraham","location":""}
