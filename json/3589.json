{"mainText":"There are very few \"celebrities\" who, when they pass on, leave me with the feeling that I have lost something dear. Steve Jobs is one of those very few. In fact, the world has lost a man who was a true visionary, a man who helped many of us love technology. I have been a Mac user since 1985 (Mac 512K with a 400K floppy drive), and today own three Macs, two iPods and an iPhone. More importantly, I recognize the creative genius that was Steve Jobs. He created products that I have loved. I can't say that about many people or many things. He will be dearly missed.","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Larry","location":""}
