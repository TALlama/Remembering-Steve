{"mainText":"All my life I've been listening how great were apple's products and how amazing was Steve Jobs', as a creator and as person. But I didn't have the chance to have a Mac. Along the years, my desire to have an Apple product increased and my affection for Steve Jobs as well. I became a big fan of him, though I didn't have a Mac.\tSo, when I read the news, I got sad, really sad. We lost a genious, a fabolous creator of amazing products and a great person. But, he left whole world of ideas, and above all an example for all the people: Mac or PC, American or Brazilian, Rich or Poor. He left a legacy of love and innovation for all of us.\nWherever you are, thank you Steve Jobs.&nbsp;","header":"with affection from brazil","author":"Rodrigo","location":"from Brazil"}
