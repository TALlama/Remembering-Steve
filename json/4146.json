{"mainText":"I am a musician and film maker, who grew up in the computer age that \nSteve Jobs helped create.  His innovations help me to express myself, \norganize my thoughts and communicate on a daily basis.  I think the real reason people love Apple products is because they have become so \nintegrated into our lives as they create new possibilities for the human \nexperience, not to just crunch numbers as computers were orinignally \ncreated to do.  Even if you aren't using an Apple product on a daily \nbasis, you are living in a world that has forever been changed and \ninfluenced by Steve Jobs and the company he co-founded.  He is our \nWright Brothers, Henry Ford, Madame Currie and Thomas Edison and history \nwill only increase his stature.","header":"Thank-you Steve","author":"Drew","location":"from Toronto, ON"}
