{"mainText":"I am Aldo a student in South East Asia.\nI feel so sorry knowing that Mr. Steve Jobs has passed away.\nFor me Steve Jobs is a real genius.\nThis world has been so advanced nowadays, it is one of what he had made.\nAs I know most movies used his creation to do the editing, also on image industries and music industries.\nHe had changed the trends in the world with iPhone, iPad, Macbook and so on.\nHe had made the people in the world become closer to technology.\nI honestly want to see more of his creations, but unluckily he has left this world.\nI hope all his family and his friends can be strengthen to deal with this sad moment.\nThanks Steve Jobs, how would today be without your creation?","header":"my thoughts","author":"Aldo","location":""}
