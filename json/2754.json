{"mainText":"Mr. Jobs knew what people wanted, and he knew how to give it to them. He had\nthe intelligence, the class, the passion, and the drive to make all of this\nhappen, and it is reflected in his products one thousand percent.\n\nI honestly hope that Mr. Jobs' legacy will continue forever. I hope that\nApple executives will ask, \"What would Steve do?\" when they design new\nproducts, and I hope that this company will continue to make me a proud\nowner of all their products that I have, and agonizingly yearn for the ones\nthat I don't.\n\n\"Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you\nwant to change the world?\"\n\nMr. Jobs, you are an inspiration to us all.\n","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Kyle","location":""}
