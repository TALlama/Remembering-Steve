{"mainText":"I'm not going to lie. I'm a PC user and have never really been a fan of\nMacs. But I can't deny what a revolutionary Steve Jobs was. The man changed\nwhat is expected of our computers, tablets, cell phones, music players, etc.\nJust about everything that we have today is based off of the model that\nSteve Jobs presented us. But more important than all these technological\nmodels he presented the world, he gave us a model of how we should be as\nhumans. His charitable works, his desire to strive to be the best he could\nbe, and his persistance to never forget who he was at heart despite all his\nsucces is an inspiration to everyone.\n\nRIP Steve Jobs... you will be missed.\n","header":"RIP Steve Jobs","author":"Avi","location":""}
