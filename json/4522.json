I am a true Apple fan and it is because of him and his vision that I can navigate my computer more easily and have it incorporated more effectively into my every day life.  I thank him. \nA Great Visionary.  When we look back in history I truly believe he will be compared to the likes of Louis Pastuer,  Thomas Eddison,  Alex Graham Bell (All men who made life easier for the common person).  \nMy condolescences to his family.   I can't imagine your  loss but your heart must swell with pride that he will live on forever.&nbsp;","header":"A Great Visionary","author":"Pam","location":""}
