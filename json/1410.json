{"mainText":"I'm so shocked to see this news on the website. I wish he can pass the sickness but this happened too soon. Steve Jobs is truly an amazing human being. Not only did he change the way how we use the smart phone but he also changed the way we listen to music. His speech at the 2005 Stanford Commencement is really inspiring to me. I'll looking forward to make my future better with it. Also im sorry about Steve Jobs loss to his family and friends. RIP Steve Jobs. You will always in our memories.
