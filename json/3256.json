{"mainText":"Hi,\n\nI don't know if you will read this, but to the family of Steve Jobs, I \nwant to express my sincere condolences.\n\nWe are all with you, and I hope you will take the time you need to go \nthought this challenge.\n\nTo Steve,\n\nI'm from Canada, and the fact that you're gone is making me realize how \nmuch you changed the way people see technology. But for me, you changed \nthe way I believe in my projects, you changed my beliefs and you changed \nme, just by being so strong when everything was against you.\n\nI will never forget you. Rest in peace, and every time I will see an \napple, I will think about all what you did.","header":"To Steve","author":"Xavier","location":""}
