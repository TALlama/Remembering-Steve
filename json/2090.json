{"mainText":"Today is a sad day for geeks everywhere. I still have my plush  \nsmackamac that my father gave to me as a little girl. we never owned  \nanything other than a apple product and in our home we were always  \n\"early adopters\". Steve Jobs is a representation of being fearless, a  \ndreamer and even of second chances. At the age of 27 being born in the  \nyear of Macintosh 1984 my life will always be affected and changed  \nbecause of Steve Jobs.\nThank you for all of your contributions.&nbsp;","header":"RIP Steve Jobs","author":"Akilah","location":""}
