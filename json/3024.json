{"mainText":"Although I am happy that Steve has found peace, it is a very sad day.\n\nI have never owned a PC and never will. My husband and I bought our first Mac in about 1989 and have owned many since. I am currently typing this on an iMac that is about 5 years old and still going strong. I won't bore you with the actual count of Apple devices in our home.\n\nI will miss his keynote speeches and know that the spirit of Apple will live on.\n\nSteve, you made the world a much better place.","header":"so sad","author":"Lynda","location":""}
