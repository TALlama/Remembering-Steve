{"mainText":"I want to say, that I'm really sad right now. My \nthoughts are with his family and friends. It is a inner necessity to me to write a little note to express why Steve had an impact on my \npersonality. It wasn't his sucsess, or the admiration other people had \nfor him. It was, primarily, his tenacity in belief that he would achieve \nsomething, if he just worked hard enough â€“ against all expectations or \ndoubts. I am just 24 and sometimes I have doubts myself, if I will \nachieve something of value in my life. But if I listen to Steve, an \ninterview, speech or keynote, I think to myself \"he did something great, \nbecause he loved it so much\" and if I can mobilize the same energy and \npassion, maybe I can do the same.\n\nHe is a Guidance to me, and he ever will be.\n\nThank you.","header":"Guidance","author":"Paul","location":""}
