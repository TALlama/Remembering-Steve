{"mainText":"Im from Argentina, and in university, Steve is always there, teachers \nand professors are always talking about him, he was awesome. I also like my Apple stuff so much, my MacBook Air, my iPhone, my iPad \n2, they have changed my life, and the lives of million of people around \nthe world. I will miss him so much, he always knew what to say. You cant imagine \nhow sad people are in South America too. RIP Steve, I just hope you can still lead Apple from wherever you are \nnow.\n\n\"Stay hungry, Stay foolish\"\n","header":"our great mentor at university","author":"Ornella","location":"from Argentina"}
