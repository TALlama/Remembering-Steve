{"mainText":"The news shocked me today when I heard of the passing of Steve Jobs. Steve has made such a big influence on how we use technology today. I remember my dad had the very first Apple computer that was made. I really didn't know Steve personally but I know that he is in a better place right now. Hopefully he can even show the lord some of his useful technology!","header":"R.I.P. Steve","author":"Patrick","location":""}
