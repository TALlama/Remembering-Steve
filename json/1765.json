{"mainText":"\nHi Apple,\n\nMy family is so sorry to hear of the death of Steve Jobs. \n\nHe shared his vision of technology and of the future with the world, for which he will never be forgotten and missed by millions. \n\nI have attached a picture of my daughter, she attended her first Apple launch (iPhone 3GS) when she was barely a week old in my arms. She continued with the first Gen iPad launch at 10 months old, then the iPad 2 launch at the age of 21 months old. \n\n","header":"Steve Jobs memories","author":"Rick","location":""}
