{"mainText":"I would like to pay my respects for Steve Jobs's family and all Apple \nmaniacs throughout the world. I recently became a full Apple user (iPod, \niPhone and iMac) and definitely he was a genius and yet, so simple and \ncharismatic - that is my feeling about him as a person. It is \nunbelievable the coverage of his ideas (i am Brazilian) and the passion \nit spread all over the world, that had lost one of its most important \nfigures. I am trully sorry for his death. I hope Apple as a company can \nalways and forever be inspired by him.\n\nAlready missing his ideas, my best regard for the Apple community","header":"My respects","author":"Paula","location":""}
