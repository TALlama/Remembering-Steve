{"mainText":"   Steve Jobs has changed so many lives, directly, and indirectly. He was\none of the greatest visionaries, if not the greatest. When Steve Jobs was\nannounced no longer alive, it felt as if a part of me has died also. He\nwasn't just a CEO of a company, but was a influential leader. Steve Jobs is\nto me, someone to be recognized, someone I have a tremendous amount of\nrespect for. He had something special that sets him apart from other\nleaders, and that he is a passionate, creative, most devoted man. Today we\nhave lost a great man who has revolutionized technology, and was always a\nstep ahead of everyone. I believe today October 5, 2011 shall be remembered\nas a sorrowful day of the death of The One and Only, Steve Jobs.","header":"Steve jobs","author":"Raymond","location":""}
