{"mainText":"When I was 3, my father bought our family an Apple II+. It is the only\nsignificant thing I remember about being three years old. Now I am 35 and my\ndaughter is 2. Her first words were 'ma' (as in more food), followed by\n'mommy/dada', followed by 'iPhone'. What a profound effect Steve Jobs and\nall of Apple have had on my life and now on my daughter's life. Keep up the\ngreat work Apple and please keep breathing life into Steve's vision, your\nvision.","header":"Thank You Steve Jobs","author":"Jamie","location":""}
