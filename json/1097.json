{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was a big inspiration to me.\n\nI didn't like myself in presentations, somehow not knowing what to do with \nmy hands. I was browsing one day and stumbled upon one of Steve's videos - \nwatching him present was amazing and awe-inspiring. Ever since that day I've \nalways looked at the same video before I go for a presentation or a \nmeeting I needed to chair and  tried to channel his poise, mimicking his \ncomposure, \n\nI've got so much confidence instilled in me because of him.\n\nMy prayers go out to his family and friends, Tim Cook, and his dedicated \nand talented employees.\n\nLilian, from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n","header":"With love.","author":"Anonymous","location":"from Malaysia"}
