{"mainText":"I would like to send my condolences to the family of Steve Jobs, and also the family at Apple. &nbsp;No man I can think of in modern history has made such a difference in the daily lives of so many people. &nbsp;His work has helped all of us connect with each other and the world. &nbsp;Although I never met him, it was obvious that his pleasant smile and demeanor touched everyone. &nbsp;He will be missed in so many ways by so many people.\n\nGod Bless and Rest in Peace.","header":"Thank you Steve Jobs","author":"Beverly","location":""}
