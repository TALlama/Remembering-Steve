{"mainText":"I first met Steve while I was working at Sperry managing our business relationship with Pixar.  I had never met anyone like him before and never anyone like him since.  During our meetings it was clear he was focused on making Pixar a success, driven to make it happen and encouraging - assuming you were on the right track!  I am thankful to have met Steve and have always appreciated the creativity he has shown us all through the Pixar movies and innovative Apple products.  We have lost a lost a true technology visionary.  My thoughts and prayers for his family tonight.&nbsp;","header":"Meeting Steve","author":"Michael","location":""}
