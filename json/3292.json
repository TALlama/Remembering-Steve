{"mainText":"I am typing this on a Macbook, with iPhone next to me, and iPod also\nsomewhere close by. So, Steve Jobs' work will always be around me. But,\nthere is something more important that I will remember him for. It is his\nStanford graduation speech that I stumbled upon a few months ago, at the\nexact time when I was making some huge professional decisions. His story\nabout embracing the unknown and \"courage to follow your heart\" was exactly\nwhat I needed to hear. I was refusing the usual path, deciding to not\nsettle, and turning down an opportunity against voices of many, because my\nheart told me it wasn't right for me. I am not sure where this uncertain,\nongoing stage of my life will take me. I am not sure whether I will succeed\nor fail. Steve's story reassures me to not just be okay with not knowing but\nto embrace the unknown with all its possibility.\n\nMay he rest in peace and my condolences to Steve's family.&nbsp;","header":"Great man","author":"Snezana","location":""}
