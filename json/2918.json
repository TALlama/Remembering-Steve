{"mainText":"To the Family, Friends, and Colleagues of Steve Jobs,\n\nMy sincere condolences from a fan, not only of Apple, but of Steve himself.  Very rarely does someone come along that not only has his gifts, but the drive and character to put them to their best use.  From afar, it seems that he succeeded not primarily because of his personal abilities, but by multiplying them exponentially through the employees of Apple and countless independent developers.  A true leader motivates and enables others to rise to their highest potential.  In succeeding at that, he has left the world a better place for all the rest of us.\n\nThank you, and my prayers will be with you all.&nbsp;","header":"Condolences","author":"Mark","location":""}
