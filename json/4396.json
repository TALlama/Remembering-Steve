{"mainText":"I've never owned one. Nor&nbsp;have I&nbsp;owned&nbsp;an iPod\nor an iPhone. But I can say without reservation that Steve Jobs was a pioneer\nwho started a company with a vision and rescued that company at one its most vulnerable\ntime and raised it to one of the greatest most revered technical giants of the\n20th and 21st century. I have the upmost respect for the man. He was what is\nbest about America. The fact that you can start with little and endeavored to\ncreate something beyond your dream.\n&nbsp;\nThank you.","header":"I'm not an Mac user","author":"Greg","location":""}
