I am shocked.\nI am a news junkie, but I had not heard anything about this!\n  I feel that I personally have been touched.\nI loved to hear him speak of his plans.\nYes, he had great vision.\nI really do not have anything to do with Steve, or Apple Computer.\n\n\tBut I own an Apple I-Mac, and I love it!\n\nI am so much older than Steve, but I am not even close to his vision  \nand intelligence.\nSteve, may you rest in peace!&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Hans","location":""}
