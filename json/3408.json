{"mainText":"I came back to my MacBook hoping for a good time on the internet looking up little Apple and tech rumors around the net. When I opened up Safari and went to Yahoo to see some news articles. I saw that Steve Jobs had passed. My heart completely fell down into a terrible mood. I then went to another website that hosts Apple rumors and read a more detailed article. I read the quotes from Steve's family and many others like Tim Cook. And my heart fell even more. I soon began to tear up. And as a junior in high school I didn't know much of Steve when I was young. But when I was introduced into the technology world. I began to look up to Steve and he was my Hero and Inspiration. The news of Steve's death has devastated me greatly. But as a student, I must strive and continue on in my studies to become an engineer at Apple and uphold Steve's legacy. Steve will always be in my heart and will forever be my hero. Rest in Peace my hero,\n                                                                                         Steve Jobs 1955 - 2011\n\n","header":"Steve","author":"Virasith","location":""}
