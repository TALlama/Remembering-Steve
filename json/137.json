{"mainText":"For years now I have followed the broadcasts of Apple Keynotes that \nalways featured Steve in his familiar, trademark dress. Watching him, he \nacted like no other CEO I've ever seen. He was always laid back, casual, \nand spoke on a personal level to his audience. Watching the Keynote felt \nlike inviting Steve into my own living room, and having him talk to me \nlike a friend. Keynotes will never be the same without him, and neither \nwill the world. May he rest in peace.\n","header":"His keynotes","author":"Les","location":""}
