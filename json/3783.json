{"mainText":"Today is a very sad day.\n\nSteve Jobs to me was the greatest inventor and innovator of our time.  \nI have been a loyal Apple customer for about 10 years and I have  \npersonally converted many friends and colleagues along the way. It was  \nSteve's creativity and attention to detail that captivated me and drew  \nme to Apple. I personally was not fortunate enough to have known him  \nbut I feel as if I did. I am very sad and my thoughts and prayers go  \nout to his family.","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Mark","location":""}
