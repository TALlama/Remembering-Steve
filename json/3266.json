{"mainText":"To say that Steve Jobs and Apple had an impact on my life would be to minimize how they impacted it.  When I was in high school I was likely the biggest, if not only, geek in their.  I was reserved and very much an introvert and often found solace with the lone Mac Classic that we had, it and I were loners in the cruel world of highschool.  Had I not found that lonely little Mac, had it not called to me in ways that other things hadn't I don't know that I would be here today.  Mr. Jobs, please rest in peace - you have truly changed the world for the better, not just for your customers but for me personally.&nbsp;","header":"Thank You Mr. Jobs","author":"Richard","location":"from Madison, Wisconsin"}
