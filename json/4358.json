{"mainText":"My heart goes out to Steve Jobs family. May he rest in peace\nHe was an amazing man and gave people what no other man can ever do and that\nis hope and faith in themselves thru his creations.\n\nI thank Steve Jobs for giving people like my mother, who is computer\nilliterate, the ability to connect with the rest of the world thru the iPad.\nUntil the creation of the iPad my mother never would approach anything that\nhad to do with technology because she was afraid to fail. It was too\ndifficult for her to use any kind of computer. Because of his incredible\naccomplishments and amazing creations, like the iPad. She now uses he iPad\non a day to day bases. She learned so much at the age of 59 than she did at\nthe age of 12. My mother never got to finish school past 5th grade but after\nlearning from the iPad my mom has changed her life in how she has improved\nin reading english and feels more in place around her owns kids to know she\nisn't left behind.\nThank you again Steve Jobs for your amazing ability to change peoples\nlives.","header":"My condolences to Steve Jobs family &amp; to the World","author":"Batoul","location":""}
