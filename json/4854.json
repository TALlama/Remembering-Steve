The iJob or iSteve could be the next iPad or iPhone, \nplease Apple, create something amazing as you always do, but name it \nafter your inventor, our role model, Steve Jobs.\n\nPlease do not dwell on the sadness of this day, instead think of all of \nthe magic he has given to my generation. He has created something \namazing, indescribable, a generation where we get it, where we want to \ninvent, to explore, he is us, he is our forefather of the MacGeneration.&nbsp;","header":"Today","author":"Kelley","location":"from Buckingham, PA"}
