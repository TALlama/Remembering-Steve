{"mainText":"Dear Apple,\n\nI was extremely sorry to hear of the loss of such a great mind, a great visionary and most of all a great man. Although I did not know him personally, it seams whenever I would watch an interview or a presentation he would give announcing a new innovative product, I felt like I did. He will be greatly missed by everyone all around the world. My condolances to his Apple family and most importantly to his immediate family. Rest in peace Steve Jobs!","header":"We'll Miss You Steve!","author":"John","location":"from Westhampton Beach, NY"}
