With out him \ncreating such a revolutionary devices the world would not be the same...\n\nHe will be missed all over the world, and i know that writing this will \nnot change anything, but i think that it is my generation that has to \nkeep his spirit alive.","header":"Thank you!!!","author":"Jake","location":""}
