{"mainText":"Steve,<div>Thanks for all you have done!  You have inspired me as a small business owner to think differently and to focus on the end product and make it as client centered as possible. I am in the financial services industry and the end product is really my advice to my clients. I believe that advice and the delivery of that advice has been positively influenced by you.\n\nI am sure Walt Disney is welcoming you home for some great discussions. I will not say the words \"rest in peace\" as I know you did not like to rest. But may you be at peace!</div>","header":"Thanks","author":"Michael","location":""}
