{"mainText":"Today, we bid farewell to a man who undertook the challenge of showing the world that technology and art can be one. His innovative mentality pioneered technology into its most beautiful form. His legacy will stand through his memory, and through his creations. We must thank Steve for his work and his everlasting dedication. We must thank him for inviting us to think outside the norm and question our limits. More than an innovator and a genius, Steve is an example.\n\nMay he rest in peace.\n","header":"","author":"Ivan","location":""}
