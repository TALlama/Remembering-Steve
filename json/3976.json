Learning how\nto code at such a young age taught me how to think and solve complex\nproblems. It led to my first job, working as a software developer when I was\nseventeen. Steve's example  made me want to start my own company, which I\nhave, and his exquisite taste has an impact of virtually every decision I\nmake. He will be missed.\n","header":"Thank You Steve","author":"Eric","location":""}
