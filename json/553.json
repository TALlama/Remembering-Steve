{"mainText":"I always thought of Steve Jobs as the greatest inventor of all time. His\ncreations, designs, personality, all unique, and all one of a kind. Whenever\nSteve came out with a new device, you'd think \"Man, i'm don't think he can\ngo any further with this\" he'd prove you wrong. Like no other human being,\nhe had the thought of only something he could come up with. Steve could turn\nthe odds around just like that. I and many others will miss Steve Jobs.\n","header":"","author":"Brendon","location":""}
