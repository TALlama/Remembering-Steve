{"mainText":"I never met nor worked for Mr. Jobs.  I am, however, one who has spent\nthe past twenty years in IT thanks to Steve and his creations.  The\nApple II was my first computer, and I have had many Apple products\never since.  As an IT Architect I was motivated to think outside the\nbox to make my designs cleaner and more user-friendly, thanks to Mr.\nJobs.  I watched all of his speeches, product releases, etc., and his\npassion for releasing the very best products was infectious.  He left\nthe world a better place than when he arrived, and I thank him for\nmaking computing fun.&nbsp;","header":"A visionary that motivated IT professionals to innovate in every area","author":"David","location":"from Tampa, FL"}
