{"mainText":"To Whom It May Concern,\n\nI just turned on my computer and it went to Apple Page, I had to take a double \ntake to see if what I was reading was actually true. While I never knew Steve, I \nwould say that I felt like I did, I have been a Apple, customer, ever since the \nApple was all in a cube. I am so sorry that this has happened as he was such a \ngreat ambassador for who he was and the product he built,   to say he did a \ngreat job would be a understatement, he was and always will be a inventor, and a \ngenus in what Apple has become today.\n\nTake for example the First Iphone, and the Ipad,  even when a lot of hard \nworking people at Apple had a lot to do with it, It would of never been what it \nwas without Steve and the amazing job, that he did at the press conference his \nword, his body language his demonstration, and the love for those new innovation \nwas heartfelt, I believe that beside the new Apple store, popping out in every \ncity, this name and product will hopefully continue to be what it is and what it \nwas, I am sorry that such a great person that I never met has left all of us. \n\n\"Steve you were and always will be a huge role model for anyone that believe in \nthere company and product.\"","header":"My Deepest Condolences","author":"Michel","location":""}
