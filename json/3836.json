{"mainText":"I think everyone has been touched, in some way, by the vision and technological advancements of Steve Jobs. In our family, we have two iPhones and two iPods and can hardly wait to upgrade to the newest technology and I am sure that most families in North America are the same. We are so thankful for the gifts that he has given us and we will personally feel the loss. We send our thoughts and prayers to his friends and loved ones and hope that they can be comforted by the knowledge that he was loved by millions and that his work will withstand the test of time.\n\nOur deepest condolences.\n","header":"Our Deepest Condolences","author":"Lisa","location":""}
