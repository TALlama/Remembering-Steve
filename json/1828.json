{"mainText":"I am only 16 years old, and just recently (past two years) got really into Apple products. I like watching the Special Apple keynotes on the new products that Apple releases, and Steve Jobs just made it what it is.&nbsp;Now, watching the new keynote with the introduction of the iPhone 4s, it’s just not the same. Mr. Cook did a great job with leading the way with the keynote, but it isn’t the same feeling as when Steve Jobs did it. It’s a part of Apple that will have to live in our memories (and YouTube). RIP Steve Jobs, My thoughts and prayers are with his family.","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Dustin","location":""}
