{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was an amazing individual. He broke the technology barrier that a\n lot of people would not ever attempt or even see in a lifetime. We only see\n this kind of person maybe once in our lifetime and we should cherish that we are so blessed. He has had me on his side with all of his products, which I\n actually have a few myself. iPhone 4 32GB, 17\" MacBook Pro, and a 27\" iMac.\n I love those machines and don't feel like any other individual could've created the empire he has built in his short lifetime. He will always be remembered.","header":"Steven Jobs.","author":"Garison","location":"from Port Orange, FL&nbsp;"}
