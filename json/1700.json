{"mainText":"You are the reason I've become an Apple man. I remember having an old Apple desktop when i was in school when they were the best around and ever since that point i haven't had anything but Apple. You've created an amazing product leading up to my Apple iPhone 4 and everytime i look at an Apple product I will think of you. Rip my friend, you will never be forgotten.","header":"To steve.","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
