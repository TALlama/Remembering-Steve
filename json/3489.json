{"mainText":"Hello and my name is Scott. My thoughts are with Steve Jobs and his family. Everyone should be thankful for the life Steve Jobs lived. His ideas, marketing, the intuition of what Apple was capable of, changed lives. Apple is a power house. I remember when I made my switch and it was the 3rd best decision of my life. Steve Jobs knew the need for technology, and had the desire to fullfill dreams, at which he did. Many people in this world have done many great things. Steve Jobs changed several industries in the world with a spark of his brain and the confidence to make it happen. Steve Jobs, you are laid to rest. Rest your body and slow your mind and know this. Apple is the most powerful, the most beautiful, the most advanced computer system in the entire world. Well done.","header":"Apple","author":"Scott","location":""}
