{"mainText":"Like millions of other people, I never knew Steve personally.  When I think\nof Apple, I think of Steve.  If I had to think of one word to describe him, \"Brilliant.\" &nbsp;I was shocked to hear of his passing, and I had the feeling\nthat I lost someone close to me, though that wasnÂ¹t the case.  He built a\ngreat company and he saved a company and made it even Greater.  My heart\ngoes out to his family, friends, and to all of his Apple family.  You will\nbe missed Mr. Jobs.","header":"Rest In Peace...","author":"Chad","location":""}
