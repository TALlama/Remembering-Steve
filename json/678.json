{"mainText":"I am really sad, but also happy that maybe people will now understand what he help create.&nbsp;It is a strange mix of feelings.\n\nWorking at an Apple reseller in the early nineties was grim. Falling sales, old technology and knee-jerk responses to competitors products were the hallmarks of the Apple product line. There were gems in there, but the future looked bleak. The return of Steve Jobs to Apple marked an almost instant shift in the perception of the company by those who worked hard at selling the product.\n\nI hope Mr. Jobs' passion, diligence and determination will continue through the company he helped create, save and make so prominent in western culture.\n\nTo Steve's family and friends, I hope his passing brought relief and closure. &nbsp;","header":"Thank You","author":"Greg","location":""}
