{"mainText":"\nI'm so sadden to here of the loss of Steve from the other side of the globe in Australia. Although I wasn't even born at the time Steve even created Apple I feel so much a part of his vision. As a college student there's no better mentor I could think of than Steve. As cheesy as it sounds whenever there was a press conference held to launch a new iPhone or iPad I felt that no matter what else was going on in the world, no matter how many wars and global financial crises present, there would always be people like Steve who with perseverance and unique creative genius could bring the world together with something as brilliant and practical as communication technology most people know today as Apple!\nThank You Steve for giving us the privilege to experience this world with your genius creations. You will be sadly missed. \t\t \t   \t\t  ","header":"","author":"Natalie","location":"from Australia"}
