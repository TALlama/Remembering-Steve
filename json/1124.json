{"mainText":"I'm deeply saddened by the news of his death, and I'm keeping his \nfamily, and friends, in my prayers.  I have been an Apple supporter for \nthe last 17 years.....have worked with Mac's since high school, and will \nhave nothing but an Apple in my home.  I have always stood by Apple and \ndefended Steve against anyone who would throw a jab at him, or Apple.  I \nloved how he would throw jabs right back @ his conferences, always made \nme laugh and always made me look forward to hearing what he had to say.  \nI had truly hoped to be able to meet him one day, as I thought he was an \namazing person.  The world lost a great man.  Thank you Steve, for all \nthat you have done for us, you saved Apple, and gave us SO MUCH MORE!  \nYou will me missed. :(\n","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Christina","location":""}
