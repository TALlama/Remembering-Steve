{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\n\n\t\tI have been working for your company for two and a half \nmonths now and was so excited to work for a company like no other \ncompany in the world.  Our products that we sell put smiles and fill our \ncustomers with joy and excitement.  To see customers play on their first \nApple product puts that excitement in me.  Knowing the products came \nfrom a person like you; you must feel that enjoyment any where you go.  \nIf this company didnt have you we wouldnt be where we are at today as a \ncompany.  You will truly be missed from this company, customers, and me. \n I and the rest of this company will still bring the excitement that you \nwant coming out of this company.&nbsp;","header":"Thanks Steve!","author":"Robbie","location":""}
