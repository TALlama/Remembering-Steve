{"mainText":"Many people want to meet actors, singers, pro athletes and so forth. The one person that I ever would've wanted to meet was Steve Jobs. He was a role model and huge influence in my life. It's very hard to believe that I could feel this sad for someone that I never got to meet, and I wish I had. He will obviously always be remembered, but I will not remember him for the iPhone, MacBook or iPad that he created, but I will always remember him as the visionary that  pushed through so many boundaries even when times were tough. His products were only a result of his mentality and vision of a better future. That's how I want to live my life. He will always hold a very special place in my heart and mind.\n\n\n\n\nRIP Steve Jobs","header":"","author":"Jorge","location":""}
