{"mainText":"RIP Steve Jobs. You were an inspiration to all of us. Apple would not have gone this far without you. I remember getting my first IPod Nano and thought it was the coolest thing ever. Then I got the I touch and next year when my contract ends I'm getting the I Phone. Let's just say I have become an apple addict. Let us have your legacy carry on. I wish I could have known you as a person not the guy that made my IPod&nbsp;better but I will always remember you for the help you gave into the world.","header":"","author":"Stephanie","location":""}
