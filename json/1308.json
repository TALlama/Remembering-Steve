{"mainText":"I didn't actually know Steve Jobs but I find myself weeping because he \nhas touched my life each and every day in so many ways.  The world has \ntruly lost a treasure of a visionary with not only the ability to see \nsomething but to make it happen and to create a culture so dedicated to \nthat vision.  My condolences to the Apple family and to his family and \nfriends who have lost so much more.","header":"condolences","author":"Annette","location":"from Burbank, California"}
