{"mainText":"To Steve's family and all the staff at Apple,\n\nThank you so much for all the wonderful work and products you have given the\nworld... I am and have been a Apple person right from the beginning. It was\nthe only computer I could use and enjoy not only for its functionality but\nalso because they are beautiful... I guess the creation always resembles the\ncreator in some way and perhaps Steve was able to take the beauty of the\nhuman mind and make it oh so functional and beautiful all at the same time.\nThe iPhone is a set beyond amazing and is so much fun... Thanks so much!\n\nPlease know I am so sorry for your loss! And so thankful and grateful for\nall your hard work and beautiful creations. Please keep his spirit alive\nthrough EXCELLENCE and pride in all that's come before... My deepest\ncondolences.","header":"Thank You!!","author":"Jorhdin","location":""}
