{"mainText":"Steve,\n\nI may have never met you but you have inspired me and pretty much every\nother techie in the world through your devices, computers and the media.\nEvery year I looked forward to the events to see what you and Apple come up\nwith. I may not own a Apple computer But I do have an iPhone 4 and a iPod\nClassic, which I wouldn't trade for any other device out there. One day I\nwill have a mac book and look back and think... Steve Jobs was a part of\nthis amazing device and everything else Apple has come up with. I'm sorry to\nhear you are gone, your are in a better place now and your don't have to\nsuffer from all the pain anymore. R.I.P for Jobs, the greatest techie of\nall!\n\n-- \nThank you","header":"To Steve Jobs, whom I never met personally","author":"Anthony","location":""}
