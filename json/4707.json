{"mainText":"Hearing the news today has really saddened me, my heart goes out to all of those that met Steve, an opportunity I can only now leave to imagination. I was happy to have had the chance to work for Apple and received a group email\n from Steve; the closest I was to get to the great man. He has touched the lives of more than he could ever realize. I wish his family all of the love a\nnd support possible and hope they are left in peace by the media to mourn th\neir huge loss. Steve has been rewarded with his place in heaven and history. You will be missed Steve, by thousands of people you never knew existed. Enjoy your peaceful place.","header":"An inspiration and amazing legacy","author":"Alan","location":""}
