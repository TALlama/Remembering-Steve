{"mainText":"My first computer was an Apple and my last computer will be an Apple.  \nComputers have been a huge part of my life since the first time I \ntouched a computer, an Apple II.  I'm a programmer now and every \nmilestone of my becoming a programmer has involved an Apple computer, \nfrom the first program that I wrote in Logo on an Apple II to the Apple \ncomputers I use now.  You are one of the most influential people on my \nlife and I thank you for that influence.  You thought different and the \nworld was a better place for it.  I'll miss you, Steve.&nbsp;","header":"Requiescat in pace","author":"Turing","location":""}
