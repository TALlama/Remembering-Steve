{"mainText":"Steve Jobs changed my life. There is rarely a moment in the day when I \nam more than a few minutes away from a product that he was responsible \nfor conceiving, innovating or introducing from my Mac to my iPhone to my \niPad to my Apple TV and to the software that runs all of them. He has \nimproved the way I do my job, communicate with my friends and family, \nproduce my podcast, share my photos, listen to music and watch TV. I \nwill miss Steve Jobs greatly.","header":"Steve Jobs Changed My Life","author":"John","location":"from Dallas, TX"}
