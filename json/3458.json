{"mainText":"\tJust the other day I listened to a college graduation speech \nJobs made at Stanford a few years ago via youtube. Sitting in the car, \non my way to another groggy day of high school, I was browsing through \nsome videos and came across Steve's speech. At first I thought, \"Well \nthis will be pretty boring, but I'll give it a try\". As I listened, I soon became intrigued with Steve's point of view and story. He was \ngenuine about what he believed in and what he did, and he sounded like \nhe loved it. I loved the idea of that. Instead of following \"the right \ntrack\" and basing my life on what the college counselors and adults say, \nI follow what I love to do. My true passion is to become a political \njournalist, partly because of what Steve Jobs has said in his speech at \nStanford, and I have to thank Steve for that.  Hearing about his passing \nreally is upsetting, the world just lost someone of a species that is \ntruly rare...a man who just loves what he does, genuine love for his \njob. Jobs was passionate about his job, and it shined through in that \nspeech. I give my true and sincere condolences to Steve's family, and to \nthe Apple community. The world has lost an icon, and a true inspiration \nfor young adults like me.","header":"Steve","author":"Caroline","location":""}
