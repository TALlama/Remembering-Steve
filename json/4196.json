{"mainText":"You know, I'm writing here because I have dreams and that man has changed my life. I'm crying right now, from the other side of the world, with my bad English, to pronounce my feelings. My feelings that I know just the Apple fans can understand.\nSteve was an amazing human being. He changed my heart and taught me the meaning of my life. I'm only 17, I learned with this man things that no one could. He\n could have a beautiful life continuation from here, but his legacy already\n won an era.\nMy heart goes for his family, his closest friends and all the ones who he touched.\n Because he's the man who made me cry for somebody I never met, but I didn\n't need to know him to know how magical he is and forever will be. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, my hero.&nbsp;","header":"The crazy one","author":"Gabriel","location":""}
