{"mainText":"If you ever do read this, I send my condolences. Steve Jobs changed my \nlife when I was 7 and got my first Apple IIe. That machine changed my \nlife forever. I've been an HONEST loyal comrade of everything Mr. Jobs \nput his mind too. He changed the way I think and interact with the \nworld. His attention to detail has never gone unnoticed in my eyes. Even \nthough I didn't know him, he's always been a big part of my life, so I \nfeel like i lost a friend and someone I can trust. He was the most \ninnovative person in the past 40 years. The world will never see someone \nlike Mr. Jobs again. I'm sorry for your loss, and my family grieves with \nyou.","header":"To the Jobs family","author":"Bryan","location":""}
