{"mainText":"I extend my personal condolences in regards to the passing of Steve Jobs. To\n me, he was a great idol and one of many sources of inspiration. Although I may have not known him personally, I was very motivated in my computer work because of him. I have faith in the future of Apple and know his last acts were done with reason and trust. Apple has a bright future on the other side of this tragic loss.&nbsp;","header":"Condolences&nbsp;","author":"Derek","location":""}
