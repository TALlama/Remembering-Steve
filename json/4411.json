He will \nalways be remembered as a visionary, a creative genius in the \ntechnological world. For this generation, the death of Steve Jobs can \nonly be equated to the death of John F. Kennedy or Princess Diana. Steve \nJobs has one way or another touched each and everyone of us in the \nworld. He will always be remembered in our life time and for life times \nto come through the Apple name. Its deeply saddening that we have lost \nsuch an iconic legend, my thoughts and prayers go to his family.","header":"A visionary passes.","author":"John","location":"from Texas"}
