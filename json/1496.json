{"mainText":"steve, the speech  you gave at stanford in 2005 changed the way i see life\nfor good. Ever since i have looked up to you, and remember your words every\ntime i had a difficult choice to make. i have my regrets but for the\nmost part i had succeeded in finding what i love to do, and doing it. And\ni owe you for that. I dont know if where ever you are now, this message will\never reach you. But rest assured your message did reach us and change us. Im\nstill hungry im still foolish. &nbsp;Good bye!\n","header":"i will always remember you!","author":"Carlos","location":""}
