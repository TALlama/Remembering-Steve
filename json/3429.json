{"mainText":"\nI only knew Steve Jobs through a succession of Apple products and services from an early iMac, a Classic iPod, a newer sleeker iMac and lastly an iPad2.  Each new Apple that came into my life allowed me to use technology to enhance living without my having to know the technical details or computer language behind the product or service.  Apple and Steve Jobs always kept the end user in mind and recognized that although most Apple users were not computer or software experts they knew how Apple products and services could take their own vision to a higher plane.  My thoughts and sympathy to the Jobs family and his colleagues at Apple.","header":"To the Apple Family","author":"Frank","location":""}
