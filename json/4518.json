{"mainText":"I remember watching Steve Jobs make a presentation to the Cupertino City\nCouncil.  I watched it on youtube.  He was presenting his vision for the new\nApple headquarters.  I was most struck by how humble he was, just standing\nthere by himself waiting for his turn to speak, seeming perhaps a little bit\nnervous or awkward.  Here was the man who had built the largest company in\nthe world and placed the headquarters in his hometown of Cupertino, now\nwaiting for his turn at the lectern to make a pitch for the new Apple\nheadquarters. He described how he had grown up in the city.  He described\nhow the company had outgrown it's facilities, forcing it to lease space\nscattered throughout the city.  This was his hometown.  He explained how he\nwanted to bring the company back together into a single, futuristic-looking\nbuilding. He spoke quietly, unhurriedly, mostly monotone, but with extreme\nclarity, precision and passion about the vision he had for Apple. It was\nbeautiful.\n","header":"I remember","author":"Peter","location":""}
