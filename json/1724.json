{"mainText":"I feel like losing Steve Jobs is a big event in our lives.  I will remember\nhow I found out like any other big event.  My roommate was on his computer\nand found out through a website when it didn't even get to any other main\nnews sites yet.  I immediately pulled out my iPhone to begin looking through\nnews apps for confirmation to no avail.  It was kind of ironic to be\nsearching for the news of Jobs' passing with the iPhone he created.  It's a\nsad day...I only hope that Apple continues this visionary's legacy by\ncontinuing to make amazing products.  I hope the revolution Apple has\ncreated will not pass with Steve Jobs.&nbsp;","header":"will remember","author":"John","location":""}
