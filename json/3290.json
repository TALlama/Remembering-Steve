{"mainText":"i have always been a huge apple fan and loved all your products. when \nsteve jobs used to announce a new product he did with pride and loved to \ndo it. i felt and still feel as though i knew him. from a young age i \nknew that when i get older i want to follow his footsteps and be as \nsuccessful as this iconic human. when i found out of his death i was \ndevastated and still am. he is one person that i will remember for the \nrest of my life. as successful as apple is and with the profit he has \nmade he was one of the rare men that still wore basic jeans and a \nrunning shoes that would bring in millions and for that reason i loved \nhim. when he announced his step down from apple i knew his time would be \ncoming to an end and sadly today is that day. Steve jobs will be in my \nheart forever and will be know as of the best men to me\nMr steve job you have inspired me and i love you although i never met \nyou i wish i did it would have been a great honour.","header":"I'm depressed","author":"Evan","location":""}
