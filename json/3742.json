{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\n\nThe tools i use to compose this email have been envisioned and realized \nby your team under your leadership. It is one thing to have a vision and \nthen another to be able to see that idea through to fabrication and \ncommercialization. I think it is safe to say that you have perfected \nthis art.\n\nCongratulations on your success in business and for setting an example \nfor future generations; whilst technological progress will have \nstuttered in the very short term as the technological industry finds \ntheir feet without you, it will surely grow exponentially as the legions \nof entrepreneurs and engineers work more inspired than ever. On this \nnote, i'd like to congratulate you as well on becoming a successful \nhuman being - this is the greatest achievement.\n\nThank you for making our lives a lot more comfortable.","header":"Thank You Steve","author":"Alex","location":"from Paranaque, Philippines"}
