{"mainText":"I know what it's like to lose someone close to me well before they should be\ngone - I was 17 when I lost my mother to cancer. My deepest condolences go\nout to Steve's family, his friends, and all of those he touched - including\nall the employees of Apple. It's hard to lose a loved one and a leader and\nhe was too young to go, despite it being his time.\n\nUnder Steve's tutelage, Apple brought the world into the era of space-age\ncomputing - things that, so far, you'd only seen in Star Trek and other\nfuturistic sci-fi movies.\n\nI remember being in elementary school (late 80s, early 90s), using the early\nMacintosh computers for programs like LOGO and having it spit giant floppy\ndiscs back at me when you didn't turn the lever all the way. And then\nwatching my school district upgrade when Apple put out more products. When I\nwas a sophmore in college, I bought my first iBook with the money I earned\nfrom my work-study job. In 2007, after working at UPS for many months to\nsave up the money, I stood in line for 13 hours to be 4th in line for the\niPhone - and I got it. I now work in advertising - an industry where the\nneed for digital superiority mandates that Apple products be the *only*option.\n\nI grew up using the products of Steve's imagination and continue to use them\nto this day and will forever be a loyal Apple fan. He made this world a\nbetter place with his innovative spirit and the world is most certainly at a\nloss.\n\nI hope Steve's family and the Apple family can find peace in this difficult\ntime. My prayers are with you.\n\n\nSincerely,&nbsp;","header":"Condolences from Atlanta","author":"Candace","location":"from Atlanta, GA"}
