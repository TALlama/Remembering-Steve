{"mainText":"Today I went to an apple store because I wanted to buy a macbook for college for the first time. I was telling my mom how amazing Steve Jobs was and all the things he had done to change this world. We get there and every one seems happy willing to help. I leave the store telling mom how we need to buy the macbook not just because Its amazing but because the people working there where so nice. They should be nice because they are representing the works of an outstanding man who has revolutionized technology and propelled us in to the future.&nbsp;\n\nYou will be missed Steve Jobs, you where an amazing man and a personal inspiration....\nThank you for everything.","header":"Funny how the world works...","author":"Jose","location":""}
