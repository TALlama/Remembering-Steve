{"mainText":"The world is dimmer today, the night sky has a new light that shines bright.\n\nSteve Jobs inventions brought me education, introduced me to my future\ncareer, brought music into my life, helped me keep close to my friends and\nfamily that were miles and oceans away...\n\nbut most importantly he and Apple gave my husband and I the tools to break\nthe wall that autism built in our son. His great dreams and making them\nreality helps us keep our son's dreams alive.\n\nFor that we will be forever grateful.Thank You Steve! Keep Dreaming!\n\nOur thoughts &amp; Prayers to his family and friends.","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Jenn, Jamie, Duncan &amp; Moira","location":""}
