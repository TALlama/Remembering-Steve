{"mainText":"Steve's approach to life and his passion for simplicity is the basis for and foundation for the career and lifestyle I have now.\n\nMy sincerest condolences go out to his family and friends. It's amazing how a man I've never had the pleasure of meeting has such an impact on my everyday life. The world is a better place now because of him and unfortunately today, a sadder one. \n\nI have no doubts that Apple's core will retain the foundation that Steve cultivated over the years.\n\nA great man but an even greater legacy.\n\nPeace and Love Steve.&nbsp;","header":"A great man","author":"Eddy","location":""}
