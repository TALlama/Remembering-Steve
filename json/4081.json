{"mainText":"\nI might be a 15 year-old child, but I have so much respect for Steve Jobs, it's not even funny. All of my life I have wanted a MacBook Pro, and an iPod Touch. I have yet to get ether. I love Apple products from the bottom of my heart, and I get to use everyone else's. It kills me. I have to install custom theme packages to make my computer \"act\" like a Mac, that's how bad I want to use the wonderful technology that Jobs has created. I watched his keynotes for every new product. I told everyone at school about the \"new stuff.\" I have a passion for Apple and always will. Steve Jobs, you will never, and I mean never, be forgotten. The man that changed history forever, Steve Jobs. R.I.P -2011. I also would like to encourage the fight against cancer, whether it be pancreatic or not, the fight for cancer will always be present. My last and final goodbyes, R.I.P Steve Jobs. Missed by a thousand hearts. \t\t \t   \t\t  ","header":"","author":"Curtis","location":""}
