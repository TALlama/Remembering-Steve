{"mainText":"  I never knew him personally, but I received the news with deep\nregret.\nSurely a man who saw beyond the horizons with a brilliant mind and\nrevolutionary. In his dictionary of words, impossible, certainly not\nexist.\nHe certainly was a milestone in technology, marketing and the power of\nboth together.\nThanks to him we now have devices that are not \"just devices.\" It\nreally changed everything.\nThe iPhone can not be classified as a cell, it is much more than that.\nAfter all, an eloquent person, friendly, and someone's sure to be\nremembered forever.\nI have no words to say how sad I am to receive the news.\nMy feelings to family, and God help you in this difficult time.\nMr. Jobs, great man, great person, and again .... Brilliant.\nGreat loss for humanity, for Apple and for all his fans, like me, who\nalways admired his ideas totally revolutionary.\nWe will miss his magic touch in making the impossible possible.&nbsp;","header":"Mr. Jobs - Brilliant mind","author":"Larissa","location":"from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil"}
