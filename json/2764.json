{"mainText":"Since the beginning of my career as a computer programmer, I used a Mac.  The functionality, beauty, and approach from your products has always inspired me to make applications that derived the same feeling.  The feeling of something just perfect, thoughtful, completely well made.  There are lots of words that can be used to convey this, but it's just a feeling.\n\nI believe it's the vision that Steve had.  That is why Apple is so awesome and why people like me, will always look up to it.\n\nThank you, Steve.","header":"one of the reasons I became a developer","author":"Richard","location":""}
