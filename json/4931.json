When I bought it there was NO ONE around in my area that had one and I had to teach myself.\nI bought a Blueberry SE, and just loved it. I bought the lap top that looked like a make up mirror,I bought another SE, I bought three Mac book pros..\nHave two ipads, two iphones, and \nSo yup, I am ad always have been a MAC girl.\nSteve Jobs was the one that got me to want a Mac, despite how the PC people would try to persuade me that a Mac is not a good thing.\nI wish Steve well where he is and I am sure he has happy and  healthy and thinking up somoe wonderful new Mac ideas.&nbsp;","header":"Been a Mac girl since the beginning","author":"Paulette","location":""}
