{"mainText":"Hi,\n\nI never had the chance to meet Steve Jobs in person, but the sudden\nrealization that I never will just struck me down with the most\nindescribable sadness. His life was an inspiration to us all, a lesson on\nchasing our dreams (and catching them), a fire on the shadows of conformism,\nthe proof that true innovation comes from following your own path.\n\nHalf the globe away, I found the foothold I needed in his words on Standford\nto stop wasting my time and start doing what I really wanted: build my own\ncompany.\n\nWe are still struggling, since dreams are like adventures, and have\nuncertain destinations. I have been developing for both Mac and iOS for the\nlast few years, out of business and pure pleasure. I hope we can eventually\nsucceed, but if we don't, at least it was worth it. Sometimes the journey\nalone is worth it, and Steve sure made the Apple road a sight worth seeing.\n\nMy condolences to all others, who just like me, have just lost their most\nbeloved flesh and blood hero.&nbsp;","header":"Goodbye Steve","author":"Raul","location":""}
