{"mainText":"My dad buying an Mac 128k and letting me run wild with it was probably one\nof the most influential events in my life. It taught me to read, it taught\nme math, and it kicked off a lifelong passion for computers and programming.\nIt's amazing to me that he and Apple designed a computer that I didn't even\nhave to know how to read to interact with *in the 80's*.\n\nI can't believe I'm getting so emotional about a person I've never met, but\nI'm tearing up. I guess I've sort of interacted with his personality in a\nlot of the products I've used, and I've always had that sense. I'll miss\nhim, I hope I'll get to keep seeing a bit of him in Apple's stuff.&nbsp;","header":"One of the most influential events in my life","author":"Eric","location":""}
