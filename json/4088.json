{"mainText":"Grateful to Steve for inspiring so many, especially by sharing his vision, and encouraging innovation in all of us.  I raised my son on apple products, and today he is photographer with a vision, inspired to tell a story through photographs.  We have a start up, that uses all Apple products, and we producing games that teach Physics.  We have a vision to re-imagine Science.  Thank you Steve.  To the Jobs family, our prayers are with you, God's peace to you. &nbsp;","header":"Inspired by Steve","author":"Mary Ann&nbsp;","location":"from San Antonio, Texas"}
