{"mainText":"Steve Jobs has affected my life to an unknowable degree. It is with \ngreat sadness that I, and a world of others, must say goodbye to a man \nwe stood in awe of.\n\nHe made it possible for me to see my family in the palm of my hand even \nthough they are, physically, 2000 km away. He lightened the load of my \nbackpack by 1kg. He made anything I could possibly need, available at \nthe touch of a finger.\n\nI use his innovations hourly, and they amaze me daily. His legacy will \nremain with me throughout my lifetime.\n\nThank you Steve.","header":"Goodbye Steve","author":"Christine","location":""}
