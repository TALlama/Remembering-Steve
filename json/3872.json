{"mainText":"My condolences to everyone who knew and loved Mr. Jobs. Without him, I would've never gotten dysentery fording the river, never would've been able to have impromptu 3 hour dance parties with my friends, never would've had the world at my fingertips, never would've truly believed that there was no limit to the imagination, and would not be nearly as close to my family and friends\n who are far away. Without Mr. Jobs, my life would be without many memories and connections. It would be a life half lived. Thanks for living your life to the fullest, Mr. Jobs, and touching and changing the world. Forever.","header":"Condolences","author":"Jennifer","location":""}
