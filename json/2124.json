{"mainText":"Steve shaped my life in many ways. I've followed him since the early 80s and have always been in awe of his creative genius. He changed the way we live, work, entertain, and educate ourselves, by  giving us the first computer\n that was really personal, and allowing us to conceive music, communications and books in an entirely different manner. His commencement speech at Stanford a few years back is a must listen/read for all. I can't help but feel\n his passing as a personal loss and my only wish is that his genius continues to live on through the fantastic company he created. Long live Apple!","header":"Mourning a personal losss","author":"Oscar","location":""}
