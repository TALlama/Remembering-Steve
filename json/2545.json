{"mainText":"No words can describe what Steve Jobs has meant to me. If someone was to \ndefine the life of Steve, you cannot do it in one word, in fact, you \ncouldn't even do it in a book. I know this letter probably will not make it far, but if it someone does \nread this, I just want to say thank you. Apple has been apart of my \nfamily, and I will continue to buy Apple products throughout my life. I \nhave no doubt that this remarkable company will excel, just like \nSteve would have wanted it. Writing this email has been so tough for I do not know what to really \nwrite. But as I am touching my fingers on this MacBook Pro, I am blessed \nthat Steve Jobs created this life for us.","header":"Steve the visionary","author":"Ryan","location":""}
