{"mainText":"Hello all,\n\nVery sad news today.\n\nSteve Jobs and Apple Computer have been a constant part of my life  \nsince 1984, when I bought the very first Mac 128.\nThroughout my years in the music and audio industry since, Apple  \nComputers in general and the genius of Steve in particular have been  \nan integral part of my work and life.\nApple computers were and still are in the forefront of computing for  \nmusic uses, and my business in the audio post production field has  \nbeen driven by Apple computers for 17 years.\n\nI am deeply indebted to Steve Jobs and his vision.\nHe envisioned how people would want to use computers and made them  \nwork that way rather that making computers that people would have to  \nfigure out how to use.\nThat was at the heart of his vision and it was an initial reason that  \nI became a Mac user.\n\nToday is indeed a very sad day.\nLong live the memory and vision of Steve.","header":"in rememberance","author":"Michael","location":"from Nashville"}
