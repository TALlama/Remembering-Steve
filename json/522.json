{"mainText":"Hello.\n\nMy name is Adam. I am in high school, and I'm fifteen. Steve Jobs has had an enormous impact on my life. How? I began using computers at the age of four because I loved Apple and Steve Jobs. In eighth grade, I began studying HTML and other computer languages, hoping to be just a little like Steve Jobs. I even began to wear my glasses daily. Every electronic in my house, whether it be a computer, phone, tablet device, or MP3 player, is 100% guaranteed to be Apple. I consider Steve to be my hero and an idol figure to me. I will miss him immensely. You will be missed, Steve. Your company will live on just as you will have wanted it to.","header":"My Thoughts on Steve","author":"Adam","location":""}
