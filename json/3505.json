{"mainText":"The life of a machead, a devotee, has not been an easy road to travel.\n Engrained early in my life was a love of all things Apple.  First, my Apple\nII+; then, my mac SE.\n\nI remember Steve leaving the company, and how hard of a struggle it was for\nthose of us scattered throughout the world, still clinging to the hope that\nApple could see through its dark days.  Meanwhile, Steve was out there,\ndeveloping his NeXT computer.\n\nWhen he returned to Apple, it was, quite literally, the Return of the King.\n Trumpets heralded his return.  At least in my head.\n\nThat he was able to take Unix, his NeXT model,  and Pixar into this century\nare testaments to his dedication and visitation.\n\nI will always cherish my Mac Cube, most of all.  It had a purity of design,\nand the coolest power button ever.  That was all Steve.\n\nI am glad I have stayed a machead my entire life.&nbsp;","header":"remembrance","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
