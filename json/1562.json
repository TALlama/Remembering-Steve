{"mainText":"To the entire Apple Family and Steve's family,\n\nOur deepest condolences.  My mother and I took computer programming \nclasses on an Apple IIe.  My 4 year old daughter learned Dolch \nwords and the fascinating world and universe on a MacBookPro, iPhone and \niPad.  We come home and often each one of us has an Apple product in our \nhands, catching up with parents, friends, work and the world around us.  \nSteve, you brought the world to our fingertips.  You have lead a team to \nvision for the possibilities of humanity in so many ways. We will miss you but know that the spirit of Apple and your legacy live \non.  Thank you.  A world mourns your loss.  Simply, you live on in every \nstart up chime.","header":"Our Family's Deepest Sympathies - Sent from Mac Mail","author":"Olive and Jay","location":""}
