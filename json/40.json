{"mainText":"My prayers goes out firstly to the Jobs family, friends and people at large who his life's work affected. I just had to thank God for his life. Through his work he literally changed my life from my first encounters with a Mac way\n back in the mid-eighties at college, through to becoming a graphic designer\n right up until today. Thank you once again Mr Steve Jobs, who made expressing my creativity a complete joy. \"once your a graphic designer, always a graphic designer\" especially with a Mac to work on. -\n Rest in peace.","header":"Deepest condolences","author":"David","location":""}
