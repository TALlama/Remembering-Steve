{"mainText":"My sincerest condolences to the family and friends of Steve Jobs.\n\nI have never felt compelled to write comments on blogs or websites but as I sit here at my desk in my theatre on Broadway typing this on my MacBook Pro, my iPad, which I use for reading music scores is beside me and my iPhone 4 is in my pocket. I also have an iMac in my home recording studio AND an Apple TV device!! To say this man had an impact on me personally would be an understatement to say the least. \n\nThis news was met in our orchestra pit with deep sadness and much discussion about what a true visionary he was.\n\nHis legacy will continue and his influence will be felt for many, many years.\n\nCheers.\n\n","header":"Condolences","author":"Steve","location":""}
