{"mainText":"Steve Jobs had a drive to innovate and make great things because that's how geniuses tick. What set him apart was his commitment to bringing his innovations to everyone, because that's who great things should be for.\n\nWhen I wake up in the morning, one of the first things I see is his quote: \"Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter to me ... Going to bed at night saying we've done something wonderful... that's what matters to me.\" Since I began applying that philosophy to everything I do - professionally, personally - I've found things tend to work out ok.\n\nThanks, Steve. Thanks for giving me great technologies to use, and even better wisdom to follow and share.","header":"","author":"Matt","location":""}
