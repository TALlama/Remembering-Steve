{"mainText":"I am deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Steve Jobs today.\n\nWhen I first heard about the passing of Mr. Jobs, the first thing I thought\nabout was how amazing it was for one person to build a company from scratch\nin a single garage to something so monumental - something that certainly\ncannot fit in a garage any longer.  But after a while, I realized that the\npassing of Steve Jobs meant more than just the death of a figurehead.  To\nme, Steve Jobs was Santa Claus.  Every Christmas, I would wake up and hope\nthe one thing I opened would be an iPod or a new Mac laptop, or even just a\ncover or a case for something.  When my dad was dying of cancer at Stony\nBrook University hospital in early 2005, one of the last memories of him\nthat I remember is giving me money to go buy the new iPod and some iPod\nsocks.  When I think back to those times, I realized that Mr. Jobs was the\nman that made the smile on my face possible all those times.\n\nI am e-mailing this wonderful company because I would like to thank you\nall.  I know it was not just Mr. Jobs that made for such happy memories, it\nwas all of you.  I know it is not going to be easy going to work tomorrow,\nknowing that such a monumental figurehead will no longer be with you.  But\nwhat you all have to remember is that myself, along with millions of\nAmericans and billions of people all around the globe are cheering for you.\nKeep the tradition going.  Make Mr. Jobs proud.  We will still be behind you\n100%.","header":"Not just an Apple figurehead - Steve Jobs was Santa Claus","author":"Mary","location":""}
