Our relationship \nhas been through the neat stuff that you made, the tools and fun gadgets \nthat I've used, that have helped me do what I love.  I've been an Apple \nuser since 1988.  Your creative genius, burning bright, has been on the \nedge of my consciousness (even as it has been under my fingertips) all \nthese years.  Thanks for the neat stuff; and thanks for the reminder \nthat the ride doesn't last anywhere near forever.&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Steven &amp; Joyce&nbsp;","location":""}
