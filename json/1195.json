{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\nYou are one of the greatest inventors and businessmen in the world. &nbsp;You really did change how we live our lives each day. &nbsp;You were also a great presenter. &nbsp;It seems like only yesterday I remember going on my first cruise ship and seeing all of these small white gadgets in people's hands. Even before that, I remember using the Macintosh computers in my elementary school. &nbsp;I remember asking my parents on that cruise ship what those gadgets were. They told me it was called an iPod, a cool gadget for listening to music. &nbsp;This was back when the first iPod came out.\nEven though I am only fourteen years old, you have given me inspiration to pursue a career focusing in on the technology and media industry.\nYou will be missed.\nRest In Peace Steve Jobs.\nI will miss you.\n\n","header":"Rest In Peace","author":"Austin","location":""}
