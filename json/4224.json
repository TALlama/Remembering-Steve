Steve took his genius and packaged it in a wonderful way that allowed us\nto use his mind and creations...then share them with our family, friends, and total strangers.

His Apple logo was the graphic of the temptation of the beginning... and until  now left a wonderful taste in our mouths.","header":"The Gift","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
