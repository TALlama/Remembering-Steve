{"mainText":"Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. \n\n\nI remember this statement very well. Particularly the line \"And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition\". Since I was recently given the oppurtunity to do so, I chose to open a unique gallery and put all my energy into my art. It's sort of strange that he died the day before my big opening. What's really funny is that my original major in college was computer animation, back when the Mac II was introduced. I've have always been a Steve Jobs follower and will continue to follow his beliefs.","header":"RIP","author":"Debbie","location":""}
