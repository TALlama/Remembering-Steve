{"mainText":"A letter to Steve. Thank you for all you have done for all of us. Your vision and your long nights away from your family and friends to bring us all into the light I thank you. I wish you well my friend and even though I did not\n know you I feel like you are apart of my family. I have a emptyness in me right now that I just can't explain. I pray for you and your family and for all of us you left behind. I love you and gods speed. You will be missed!&nbsp;","header":"Thank you,","author":"David","location":""}
