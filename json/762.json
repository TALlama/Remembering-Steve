{"mainText":"Hello Steve,\n\nJust wanted to write this down pretending that you may read it, to thank you\nfor giving me hope.  I once saw a video of one of your speeches at Stanford and I still remember some of the things you said, how everything we learn\ncan be used even if what we are doing may seem unrelated, how perseverance\nand determination can make a person stand out from others, and how the love\nfor something you do can bring a change in the life of millions of people.\nI appreciate your willingness to share your wisdom, and for letting me know\nthat I may someday live the dreams I pursue.\n\nHoping we meet someday.\n","header":"Farewell","author":"Mario","location":""}
