{"mainText":"\tThank you Steve for being a man whose vision was bigger than life.   \nYou had a hand in every computer I have owned.  From the Macintosh  \nSE30 I bought in 1988 to my Mac Pro today.  You opened up the world of  \ncomputing to those of us who didn't possess a degree in computer  \nengineering.  I will miss you and your creative spirit and your always  \nintriguing \"Oh.... and one more thing...\" at the end of your keynotes  \nthat always meant something exciting was going to be announced.\n\nGod Speed on your continued journey.  Blessing to your family in this  \ntime of grief.","header":"Thank you Steve!","author":"John","location":"from Gainesville, FL"}
