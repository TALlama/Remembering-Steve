{"mainText":"My prayers go out to Steve's family, friends and  co-workers.  Today the \nworld has lost one of the most amazing human  beings, but Heaven has gained a \nwonderful angel.  \n \nSteve first touched my life in 1983 when the first computer I ever  learned \nto use was the original Mac.  No hard drive, one floppy disk drive,  small \nblack and white screen and this crazy thing called a mouse.  One  \"click\" \nand I was hooked.  Many Macs, iPods, iPhones and iPad later,  I'm still \nimpressed and always a fan.\n \nMy deepest condolences.&nbsp;","header":"","author":"Joanne","location":"from Geneva, Illinois"}
