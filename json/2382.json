{"mainText":"This evening, came home deeply saddened by news we all expected and yet, \nfor so many fans, dreaded.  We found our kids on their way to bed, but \nour nine-year-old son asked for a five-minute reprieve so we might \nlisten to a piece of music he had just created for the first time on \nGarageBand.  Steve Jobs is largely responsible for handing over the \nfreedom for so many, young and old, to build on their dreams.  The gift \nof tools for creativity and innovation he has given our generation and \nthose to come are designed by his his own unique vision of heart, spirit \nand mind combined. We are all grateful and forever in his debt.  Farewell on the journey \nahead our dear friend.","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Hannah","location":""}
