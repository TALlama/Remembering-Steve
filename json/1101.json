{"mainText":"Just wanted to say my son never met Steve but you would swear they were best\nfriends!!  Charles is a 3rd year student at UVA and during his freshman year\nin high school, he fell in love with Steve's passion.  We, as a family, would\ntalk about Apple and Steve around the dinner table.  Steve was my son's hero\nbecause he proved as long as you really loved what you do and had the desire\nfor all to win......Success was inevitable.   Steve's passion was contagious\nand therefore, he will live on in the hearts of all of us.  What an\ninspiration for a kid now in college!  Hopefully, my son will follow in\nSteve's \"heartsteps\".\n\nWith much love and joy!","header":"A memory","author":"Donna","location":""}
