{"mainText":"I can't even begin to explain how much this news has moved me. Since I was a little kid, I had always aspired to be an innovator, a forward thinker, a game changer. Steve Jobs was the one man I could always look to for inspiration, and seeing him pass today is heart breaking. I remember the joys of getting my first PowerBook G4, reloading the internet in class to see when the latest keynote would be posted, and going into the Apple store to play with the new machinery he so directly influenced. From reshaping the personal computing industry, to inventing the media platform, to introducing the world to the next-generation mobile standard, Jobs has had a lasting influence on the world that will not be shaken off any time soon.\n\nI wasn't surprised that I welled up when I read the news about Steve's passing away. I've become so dazzled by the visionary that any less would have not been appropriate for me. It's my duty to pay my respects to the man who truly changed the world as we know it.\n\nA Da Vinci of modern times. Thanks for everything, Steve.&nbsp;","header":"Steve","author":"Anil","location":""}
