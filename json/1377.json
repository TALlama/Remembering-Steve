{"mainText":"What a sad sad day. I never met him but he inspired me so much throughout my\n life. What he accomplished was akin to the Thomas Eddison &amp; Albert Einstein's of the world and even though it is crazy for someone who has never met him, I felt so sad inside when I found out.  He inspired me to dream about technology in a way that no one else has or probably ever will.  For that I am selfishly sad to hear of his passing and think he will continue to inspire me like he always has.  My prayers are with him and his family tonight. Thank you Steve, thank you!","header":"Steve","author":"Ed","location":""}
