{"mainText":"I never had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Jobs, and I'm not sure I know anyone\nwho has. Nevertheless, I sit here on this Wednesday evening in New York\nCity, crying at the loss of a man who changed the way we live, and inspired\ngenerations. I lost my mother at the age of 59 to cancer, in 2004 - the pain\nof losing great people is immeasurable. Many visionaries and leaders have\nwalked the earth, but few have had the impact Mr. Jobs has. We are all\nbetter for his work.\n\nMy deepest condolences.","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Jeffrey","location":""}
