{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was the greatest person anybody could ever hope to be. He has brought technology into the world that has literally changed lives. As I sit here and type this on my iPhone I recall as a 16 year old boy buying my first i\nPod. The excitement level was overwhelming. As I grew up my apple collection\n evolved and the release of every new keynote by Steve would leave me in tears, marveling at how possible the impossible had become. You haven't just given me a product Steve. You have inspired me to be better in life. You are t\nhe reason I try harder every day at work and why I turn negatives in my life\n into positives. You will always be my hero. Rest in Peace Steve.&nbsp;","header":"Message sent from my iPhone","author":"Travis","location":""}
