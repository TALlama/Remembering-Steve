{"mainText":" I would like to thank Steve's closest family and friends for sharing him with the world. I know very little about his personal life except for a few sweet insights I've gleaned here and there, but I suspect as someone who brought so much to the larger world and to his business, his immediate circle probably always wished they could have had more of him. Thank you for letting him pursue his passion and be the man and human being he was; that is the greatest gift of all. \n\nMy condolences and my appreciation to you. And to Steve, thank you for your legacy of what it means to inspire and lead. &nbsp;","header":"To Steve's family: thank you for sharing him","author":"Andy","location":""}
