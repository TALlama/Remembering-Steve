{"mainText":"“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t\nbe trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s\nthinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner\nvoice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and\nintuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.\nEverything else is secondary.”\n\nThank you for all that you've done, Steve.  The world won't be the same\nwithout you.&nbsp;","header":"Thank you for everything, Steve","author":"Matt","location":""}
