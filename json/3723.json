{"mainText":"It may seem a bit odd that a Freshmen in high school is paying his respects to such an important person as the one the world has lost recently, but when I\n heard the news I felt my heart drop a little bit inside of me.\n\nAs a fifth grader, my class was instructed to do a biography on a significant person. Mr. Jobs was on the cover of magazines across the world with the debut of the first iPhone, and I knew on whom I was going to do my biography. Ever since studying this truly important man who has revolutionized the world in which we live today, I have been in awe of him and have said to myself on multiple occasions: \"Wow, I wanna be like him when I grow up.\"\n\nNow that he has passed, I feel like there is a void in everything I have known to come and appreciate regarding all things technology. In retrospect, however, I realize how great of a legacy he has left behind. Now more than ever, he will inspire many people to follow in his footsteps.Thank you, Mr. Jobs. You will be forever remembered and respected.","header":"Condolences","author":"Aaron","location":""}
