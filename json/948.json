It changed my\nlife. I was able to write and read it over. My ideas became\nconcrete on the page. But as I, and Apple evolved I became more creative. Programs like GarageBand, Keynote, iMovie became20\nmy voice and my vision.  I have been able to thrive in several different fields. I went from shy and scared to outgoing and a voice for others. 46rom presenting ideas with keynote to taking it online with iWeb. My \nintegrated\nilife has allowed me to succeed.  If it wasn't for Steve Jobs and Apple \nI would not\nbe who I am today. Apple has transformed society, whether it be me \nsitting at a local civic committee meeting, to a government minister with an iPad. Thank you\nSteve Jobs.","header":"thanks steve","author":"Iain","location":""}
