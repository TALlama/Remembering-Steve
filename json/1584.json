{"mainText":"Steve, \n\n \n\nI never met you. I never shared a word with you, but you changed my life\nwhen i needed it. Your Stanford speech is the best I've ever listened to and\nit helped me when I hesitated. You were one of my heroes, I just can't\nbelieve you're gone now. I thought that only stupid people would cry when a\nfamous person died? until this happened. I know you won't read this, but I\njust want to thank you for changing my life and I promise I won't let you\ndown on this.","header":"RIP","author":"Luis","location":""}
