{"mainText":"In 2008, after nearly 20 years of working with computers, I was burnt out. It wasn't fun anymore. My brand-new, $3,000 laptop didn't do half of what it was supposed to do right out of the box. \n\nThen someone said, \"You really should have a look at the Macbook Pro...\"\n\nI did, and I never looked back.\n\nThank you, Steve, for making computing fun again. I will miss watching your presentations. I will miss hearing about \"one more thing\".\n","header":"Farewell Steve","author":"John","location":""}
