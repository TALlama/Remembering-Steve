{"mainText":"Like so many others I'm deeply saddened to hear of Steve's death. He has had\n an immeasurable impact on the way I use technology - I'm writing this on my\n iPhone, whilst watching a movie on my apple tv. I listen to music that I AirPlay to my apple tv from my iTunes on my iMac, iPhone or (god forbid) my pc\n. Steve jobs has directly influenced how I do things every day.","header":"Vale","author":"Gareth","location":""}
