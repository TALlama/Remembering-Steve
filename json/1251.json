{"mainText":"To Mr Steve Jobs,\n\nWe never met, and we never talked although I've sent you several emails\nbefore. It's such a pity for me that I never had the oppotunity to see you\nin person.\n\nAs a genius and a legendary figure that is really larger than life, you've\nbeen my mentor and changed my life. I will always remember to \"Stay hungry,\nstay foolish.\" and \"follow my heart\".\n\nWould like to talk to you again in several decades :-)\n\nR.I.P ","header":"You'll always live in my heart","author":"Rock","location":""}
