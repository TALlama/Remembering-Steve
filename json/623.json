{"mainText":"There no words for this lose, i've been a fan of apple who is Steve jobs for\n a few years. Reading about his past, how he got to where he was is inspiring. I loved hearing his interviews his insight and just hearing him talk. He brought so much to this world and will miss him, every time i hold my iPhone or a Mac its his legacy that im holding. There are no words that i can say to the family, but i cry with them and my prayers go out to them that the Lord may give you strength.&nbsp;","header":"Sometimes there are no words","author":"Randy&nbsp;","location":""}
