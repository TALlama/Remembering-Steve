{"mainText":"RIP Mr Jobs.  \n\nI would like to thank you for being a visionary and pioneer.  I remember the first computer that I'd ever seen.   We had a computer lab in our school filled with Apples - the good ol' Macintosh.  I used to love sneaking off to the lab and playing Oregon Trail.  I learned how to type on an Apple.  I remember getting an \"A+\" on the first research paper that I used an Apple to generate.  Granted, the research paper was only about 3 paragraphs discussing the solar system, as understood by a 2nd grader (but I still got an A+).   I was introduced to the world wide web on an Apple.  WOW!  My first computer was one of the colorful Macs (I think from the mid/late-90's or so).  From then, as I have grown into an adult, I've purchased my own MacBook.  My iPod kept me sane in law school.  I cannot go through the day without my iPhone and I am totally in love with my iPad.  Thank you for daring to dream and changing my life.\n\nMay your legacy live on.\n","header":"Thanks for Everything","author":"Robyn","location":""}
