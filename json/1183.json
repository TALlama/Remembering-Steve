{"mainText":"It's a sad day, we've lost a great man, Steve Jobs, my heart is broken and truly goes out to his family and close friends.&nbsp;I'm sooooo bummed about Steve, I've been choking back tears for hours now. I worked on my first Apple Macintosh computer in 1986, it was an SE 30 w/ 9 inch black and white screen, been a fan ever since. I've owned several Macs over the years. Steve Jobs is the reason I'm a Graphic Designer today because w/out Apple I would not create, funny how you just realized who inspires you once they have passed.&nbsp;May he rest in peace and be surrounded by all the cool Apple products he created. Farewell my friend,&nbsp;you will be missed greatly.","header":"Farewell Genius.","author":"Audrey","location":""}
