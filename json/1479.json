{"mainText":"\nSteve Jobs touched my life by making great products: my first iPod was a white shuffle, my first laptop was a MacBook. These and many others I have purchased over the years have brought joy, productivity and a sense of awe. It was Steve's passion for his work, his belief in the things Apple made, that set him apart from the rest. The world is dimmer losing such a brilliant light.\n\nMy respectful condolences and thoughts to Steve's family, friends and the Apple Team. \n\nMay we all keep to belief that the world can change, and we can make it better.&nbsp;","header":"My condolences","author":"Stephen","location":""}
