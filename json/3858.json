{"mainText":"As a true visionary, I have always looked up to Steve Jobs. Since I was 5 or\n6 years old, I've loved computers and have loved figuring out how things\nwork. Thanks to Steve Jobs, he's made me want to do something important with\nmy life. He has set the standard for technology, and I'm very proud to say\nthat I've grown up around his amazing work. He's impacted my life more than\nmost of my family, and I'm reacting worse than passing of family members.\nThere's a slim chance that any one, in this day and age, could surpass the\nimpact on society that Steve Jobs has given us.\n\nRest in Peace, Steve.\n","header":"Remembering Steve Jobs...","author":"Lucas","location":""}
