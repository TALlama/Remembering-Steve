{"mainText":"Mr. Jobs was an inspiration to me as a teacher of elementary school students!   I can remember cherishing my first IBM computer and marveling at the pure magic of it all when I was a child.  Now that I am an adult, I am blessed every time I see one of my students work with an iPad or iPod.  I see a spark of creative magic that Mr. Jobs himself would have been proud to see.  I could only imagine Mr. Jobs having the same spark of genius in his eyes when he was their age.  I pray that Mr. Jobs was able to see the final good work of his hands with the iPhone 4S!   I am hopeful that my students path will be just as bright as the path Mr. Jobs and Apple blazed before them.  Rest in Peace Mr. Jobs, the world is a better place because you lived!","header":"Great Loss of a Great Mind","author":"Margaret","location":"from South Carolina"}
