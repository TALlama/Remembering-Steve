{"mainText":"Steve was someone that cannot be replaced, someone the world may never get a\n chance to experience again. He was a man that had a passion for technology and has shaped the technology world to what it is today. There may be men that try to live up to him and make a fortune that will far surpass what he made. But they will never do it the way steve did. Today is a great day of sadness. As I type this email on my iPhone I will forever thank steve for giving\n me a piece of technology that I can share with my children and for making my life so much easier, with every click on this phone I will forever remember him.","header":"Steve was an amazing guy","author":"Eric","location":""}
