{"mainText":"Steve\n\nThank you for everything.  Without you I would not know the joy of a Pixar\nfilm.  My children would not know the joy and the wonder of watching every\nfilm Pixar ever made.  Without you, my children would not have their Ipod\nNano's to help entertain them during long car trips and help them focus\nwhile they do their homework and their reading.  Thank you for my 1st\ncomputer, an Apple II.  I had so much fun as a child playing on it.  My\ncellphone contract is up and I am getting my 1st iphone next month.  I have\nbeen waiting for that day for 2 years.  Thank you for being an innovator.\nThank you for being a dreamer.  Thank you for always making your dreams into\nreality.  You will be missed but I will think of you every day when I use my\nipod to listen to my favorite songs, when I go to itunes and download my\nfavorite podcasts and songs I havent heard in years. Thank you, Thank you,\nThank you.","header":"Thank you","author":"Mary","location":""}
