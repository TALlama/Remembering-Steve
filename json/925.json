{"mainText":"Hi\nThe loss of such a human being is a big one for the world.  Steve, we hope that your trip is as awesome as the amazing creations that you left us with! We will forever be amazed with your kind of imagination and creativity, you were a gift for us all! Our son, had an assignment from school in which\nhe was supposed to pretend to be a person he admires... he chose you! He made a big poster with a computer and put his face through it and started talking\nabout all the amazing things you had created... I just told him you died (he is 9) and he sat down and sobbed...&nbsp;We will miss you.","header":"thank you","author":"Regina","location":"from Los Angeles, CA"}
