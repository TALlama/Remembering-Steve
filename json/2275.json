{"mainText":"My first computer was an Apple ][ that my boss had on my desk waiting \nfor me on my first day.\n\nIt was one of the first 16,000 made.\n\nWe went on to have one of the first design Macs, a Lisa, and a Macintosh II.\n\nMy boss had vision, and was a great mentor to me.\n\nApple says that Steve Jobs was \"an inspiring mentor.\"\n\nThese two men changed my life.\n\nI am lucky to have known a great mentor, and the products of Steve \nJobs.  So, I can only have a pale view of the richness this man brought \nto Apple and its employees.\n\nRest in peace, genius.  The world is a better place because of your life.","header":"My Mentor and Steve Jobs","author":"Billy","location":""}
