{"mainText":"\nMy colleagues laugh at me because I still have 6 functioning Apple iie computers alive in my special education classroom. I have to periodically open them up and fiddle with their innards to keep them running, and so far, they have stepped up to bat in helping my learning disabled students improve in reading, spelling and math by using them on a daily basis. To you, Steve, I offer my heartfelt thanks for creating a device that is at the same time a fun thing for kids to interact with, a learning tool, and a beginning step to computer literacy. I honestly do not know what I would have done without them over my 30+ years as a special educator. I don't mind the ridicule of my peers; I have helped little kids take that important first step into the cyberworld. I couldn't have done it without you! I just wanted to offer some retro thanks for your inspiring genius.","header":"Thanks to Apple iie","author":"Betsy","location":"from Arrowhead, CA"}
