{"mainText":"In 1984 I was a senior in high school and my father brought home a 128k \nMac. I could use a computer. I've been using Steve's products for the \nlast  27 years. Each and every one of them changed how I looked at \nthings. I always describe to friends my feelings about Apple's products \nthat using them is fun. Using PC's was working, using Macs was like \nplaying they were just fun. Steve Jobs changed my profession, he made it \neasier. That's what he has always done. Thank you Mr. Jobs. You have \nenriched my life and that of my family.","header":"He dented my universe","author":"Chuck","location":""}
