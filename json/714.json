{"mainText":"Steve Jobs, He gave us Lisa, NeXT, Pixar, Mac OSX, iMac, iPhone, iPad and that well \nknow startup sound \"DUNG\", just to name a few. This was a man who had a vision \nof the future and acted on it, a man who saw what the world needed and gave it \nto us, a man who I think wore a black turtleneck, blue jeans and new balance \nsneakers everyday of his life. He is and his products will always be legend. \nAs a role model of mine, he will be missed.\n","header":"My Condolences","author":"Steven","location":""}
