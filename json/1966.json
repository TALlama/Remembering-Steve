{"mainText":"Dear Apple,\n\nI remember the first time my dad bought me an Apple Ipod.&nbsp; I think it was the 2nd generation with the click wheel and the four buttons on top.&nbsp; i was really amazed and thought whoever invented such.&nbsp; I admire the man who provided the world with so much ease and comfort with technology.&nbsp; I never thought that being a \"techie\" would be so cool.&nbsp; Steve Jobs made the world love technology and learn from it even more.\n\nWe will forever be grateful for sharing his inventions.&nbsp; I know it's impossible but I hope that there will be another Steve Jobs to further more impossible inventions.\n\nThanks Steve.&nbsp;","header":"","author":"Ching","location":""}
