{"mainText":"Good evening\n\nI send my condolences to the family of a wonderful visionary from a  \nproduct of his genius. I purchased my first computer, MacBook. It took  \nsome time to pick out a laptop but I knew I had to go with quality.  \nHis passion to make life simple and functional have proven to affect  \nmany a marketer and consumer. One thing that I noticed with my new  \nboyfriend is that he has a MacBook Pro. I think he's a keeper. That  \nwas the deciding factor. I mean he has to have sense and be a good  \ndecision maker if he has an Apple product. I can't help but smile as I  \nthink of how my family is such an Apple family. I am sure that you all  \nknow the impact he has had on everyone's lives.\n\nWe appreciate, admire and love his legacy.","header":"My condolences","author":"sohna","location":""}
