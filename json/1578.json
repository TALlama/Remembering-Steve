It was Steve Job's job to believe.\n\nI am really sorry for the loss and I can only imagine how difficult this\ntime has to be for all the people that were closest to him.\nNo money, no power, no prestige can ever substitute for a man of such\nmagnitude.&nbsp;","header":"Condolences to Steve Jobs' family","author":"Dawid","location":""}
