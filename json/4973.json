{"mainText":"Not too many people can be distinguished with the honor of truly changing the world, but I think Steve Jobs is definitely someone who has done just that. No one brand name that I have seen in my short lifetime has been as innovative as Apple products. Steve was synonymous with the overall excellence of his company. He is a legendary inventor and a true visionary. Technology took such a big leap forward thanks to Steve's unparalleled innovations. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family. RIP Steve Jobs.","header":"","author":"Scott","location":""}
