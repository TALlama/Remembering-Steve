{"mainText":"\nYou are a visionary. You try to see good when things get scary. You speak with wisdom and grace. No matter what, there is no trace of arrogance on your face. You may not have noticed, but man, you can teach. And you certainly reached many people with your speech. You spoke of following dreams, of life and death situations. Some things may seem impossible. But all one needs is dedication. And what you said about connecting the dots I sure liked that a lot You give people hope. No matter how steep the slope. And that why we're gonna get up and go. We'll reach high. Because I hope you know that your stories of the past have touched the future and nobody lasts so people lets get out of this stupor and go.\nThank you Steve Jobs, your wisdom will always be remembered. \t\t \t   \t\t  \n","header":"to Steve and his family","author":"Reem","location":""}
