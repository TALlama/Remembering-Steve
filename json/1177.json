{"mainText":"My most sincere and deepest condolences to his family and the Apple family. What sad news.  Just recently I heard the talk he had given at Stanford University's graduation ceremony, and was amazed to learn the life he had led--not always an easy one--and the lessons he learned from it.  He had an incredible vision for what was possible... or, better yet, that nothing is impossible.  I can imagine that his creative legacy will continue to inspire many people... even though individuals like him only come around every once in a while.","header":"Remembering Steve Jobs","author":"Carolina","location":""}
