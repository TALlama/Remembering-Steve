{"mainText":"I feel like I lost a friend. I have so many Apple products because of him. He made it fun then added business to it. He made me smile, laugh and learn. He gave us so much but he did it by getting you excited about every product. Complete genius, gentleman and will be terribly missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his family. Very sad day. Thanks for making life more fun and exciting Mr Jobs. R.I.P. ","header":"RIP Steve Jobs","author":"Pat","location":""}
