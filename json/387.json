{"mainText":"Steve Jobs is one inspiring, motivational, savvy, man. Being only 11 I can\nspeak for my generation, that we haven't known Steve Jobs for the longest\ntime, but in our era he changed the meaning of computer and took the word\nelectronic much further than it has ever been. He has lived a full life and\nsent a good message to everyone on this planet. Without Mr. Jobs, we would\nhave been several steps back than where we are today. Mr.Jobs surely did\n\"Think Different\" and had a confident attitude. RIP Steve Jobs. Our thought\ngo out to your family and friends. &nbsp;","header":"RIP, our vision for the future, Steve Jobs","author":"Alyssa","location":""}
