{"mainText":"Remembering? How can I forget!. I have lived among Apple products since 1981, when I acquired my Apple IIe (still have it and works). I feel the loss as if it was part of my family. Steve jobs IS part of my family. He will live forever on every drawing that I made with Mac paint, on every print out from my imagewriter, on every email that I have ever written on my iPhone, iPad, Mac pro, MacBook air, MacBook pro. &nbsp;I will continue to listen and enjoying his legacy every time I start my Harley Davidson and my HD branded iPod nano starts to play.\nI live immersed in an Apple world.\nMr. Jobs , thank you for making our lives so much better in so many ways.\nIt's hard to believe than physically you are no longer with us but in my house , you will live in every corner forever.","header":"Never forget","author":"David","location":""}
