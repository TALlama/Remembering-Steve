{"mainText":"I was truly shocked upon hearing of Steveâ€™s death! I could not believe that such a person had just departed so quietly. I always imagined he would have gone out in style but, i guess to some extent, he has gone in style, with Apple still going strong and all.\n\nI have never known him personally but i extend my deepest condolences to his family, friends and co-workers. \n\nSteve Jobs will always be remembered for his excellent work with technology and his memory and work will always live on.","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Rajiv","location":""}
