{"mainText":"I have never been so sad. Even though my grandpa and my grandma have died at a very young age and \nmy father has had a heart attack and a lot of different life threatening \nillnesses in a very young age, I have never thought about a person as \nmuch as i do right now about steve jobs. he invented all the stuff i am \nusing everyday. he is the perfect legend for the 21rst century and \nshould be honored perfectly.\n\n best regards to steve jobs' family.","header":"","author":"Kjell","location":""}
