{"mainText":"\nThank you, Steve.  Thank you for everything you have done in the computer, music, and tablet industries.  Thank you for being a great person who was very determined in your work and who was a great role model for many people. \n I know how hard this is to go through because my dad had some of the same i\nllnesses that you had and at one point looked exactly like you.  I pray for you and your family, and hope that you know you were loved and now missed.  Rest in peace Steve, I know you are in a better place now.&nbsp;","header":"","author":"Ben","location":""}
