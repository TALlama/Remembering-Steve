{"mainText":"I'm 13 and have always looked up to Steve.  He has changed the world; he \nrevolutionized the way we all communicate now and changed our lives. It \nwas sad not seeing him yesterday at the Keynote but now we know why. My \ncondolences go out to his friends and family and all the people at Apple \nthat have the chance to be apart of his life. Apple will continue to \ngrow and succeed.\n\nSo simply rest in peace Steve, you were a great man and you will be \nmissed.\n","header":"Rembering Steve","author":"Ethan","location":""}
