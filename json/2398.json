{"mainText":"Mr. Jobs has been a large part of my life for years. Although I and nobody in my life has met him, my father has always spoken very highly of him. I express my deepest condolences to his family, friends, and coworkers. I am positive that even longer than Apple or even technology, all will remember Steve\n Jobs for his innovation at such an young age and helping so many people along the way with jobs, experience, and even just the products themselves. I am right now typing this message on my iPad, which has helped me in more ways\n than I can describe. The best physical gift I have ever received is my iPod\n Classic that has made me love music once again. My thoughts and prayers are\n with him tonight. God bless.&nbsp;","header":"We Will Remember","author":"Emily","location":""}
