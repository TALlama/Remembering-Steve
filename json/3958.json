{"mainText":"Wow. Steve was such an inspiration to us all- a visionary, a leader, and a man, who without his contributions, the world would be a different place. His ideas, and inventions really changed the way we use our lives today, and we take technology for granted sometimes. He really made a contribution to the world, and was extraordinary and set his standards high. May his family, and the Apple family be consoled.","header":"steve","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
