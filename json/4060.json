{"mainText":"While I was never an Apple user; I remember using Apple computers in school\nbefore the Windows era of computing came to be. My first computer\nexperienced happened on an iMac from 1999/2000. I remember thinking to\nmyself when using it in school just how fast and beautifully designed it was\nin comparison to the other computers that were running Windows variants.\n\nSteve was a great part of Apple and he helped define the way people viewed\ntheir computers and phones. He was one of the first to fully support touch\ntechnology as well and make it work like a charm. I still remember the\nmoment I first saw an iPhone commercial and I thought to myself; \"Wow,\nthat's a really amazing phone. Finally, something that I could use\".\n\nMy thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by this horrible loss.\nWhile we may have lost a legend who helped show technology in a edgy light;\nwe will never lose the spirit that shapes Apple as being one of the many\namazing and truly special companies out there. It's a shame to see him go so\nsoon, but may he look down upon everyone with smiles knowing in the skies\njust what an amazing legacy he left behind. This isn't the end but only the\nstart of something even more beautiful than imagined.\n\nR.I.P Steve Jobs. You will be missed but never forgotten.","header":"R.I.P Steve","author":"Branni","location":""}
