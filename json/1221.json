{"mainText":"Thank You Steve, for countless life enhancing contributions.  I imagined a\nworld where you never existed and it is a much darker place that I want\nnothing to do with.  Instead, our lives are made much easier.  Your early\ncontributions started a wave of technology that literally changed the world\nas we know it.  Your new contributions could be considered even more\nimpressive.  The world owes you a debt that could never be re-payed in\ndollars, yen, or any other currency.\n\nEvery time I look at this beautiful screen with an apple silhouette I will\nthink of you.  Thank you so, so much for everything... You will be missed.","header":"Thank You","author":"Steve","location":""}
