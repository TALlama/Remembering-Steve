{"mainText":"Steve was an amazing person, a master innovator, and the greatest thinker in the entire technology industry. He wanted simplicity, he made simplicity. He was focused on making sure everything Apple made was perfect. He has done so much for the world, and his legacy will live on for years to come. I'm sure Steve had many more products and theories in mind. It is terribly saddening that his life ended so early. He could have done so many more things, if only given the time.\n\nRest In Peace, Steve. You will never be forgotten.","header":"Remembering Steve Jobs","author":"Johnathan","location":""}
