{"mainText":"Steve Jobs changed the way we live. He drove the personal computer industry, allowing people to communicate with friends and family all over the world. He brought the iPad to the world; a magical device that can allow people with disabilities to communicate better. You have inspired many people, including myself, to create. The devices you have created have allowed filmmakers, programmers, photographers, and many others to express their ideas with the world. Not only have you changed the world for the better, but you have allowed others to do the same. For that and more, we thank you.\n\nMy deepest condolences go out to his family and friends.\n\nYou've inspired many, Steve, with your beliefs and ideas.\n\nConsider the universe dinged.\n\n","header":"","author":"Robert","location":""}
