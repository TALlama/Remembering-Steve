You have  \ngiven us so much opportunity with your products and ideas.\n\nAs a follower of the Apple dream from as early as 1984, when I was  \nworking for the Apple advertising account in Germany, I have been a  \nsupporter and fan. I had the good fortune to meet you in your office  \nin Cupertino in '84 and it was then that I got a glimpse of the genius  \nthat you have been all these years.\n\nRest in peace and I will never tire to spread your gospel.&nbsp;","header":"My Condolences","author":"Hans","location":""}
