{"mainText":"I cried today when I heard of Steve's death. I have been an Apple user since\n 1984 and have enjoyed watching all the changes and innovations over the years. Many of them under Steve's direction. Even though I expected to hear of his death in the near future... I was not prepared for it so soon. My condolences to his family and friends. I will finish with an old Irish Proverb.\n\n\"Death leaves a heartache no one can heal. Love leaves a memory no one can steal\"\n\nRest in Peace Steve Jobs.&nbsp;","header":"Steve's passing","author":"Donna","location":"from Arizona"}
