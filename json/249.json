{"mainText":"I am a man who has, since childhood, always loved technology and everything 'gadget'.  Steve Jobs' Apple has always challenged innovation to the limit, and it continues to amaze me in what it is able to produce.  All of my biggest and best 'wow' moments when it comes to technology I owe to Apple and particularly to Steve, from the first Mac computers, to the iPod, the Mac Mini, the iPhone, the MacBook and MacBook Air, all of which I have owned or now own.  There is just something about these products, their design and their intuitiveness, that they almost 'know' you, know what you want them to do and how to make your life easier and more fun.  No other technology brand has done that for me.\n\nSo thank you, Steve.  I am deeply saddened that you are gone and my thoughts go out to your family and your devoted company staff at this difficult time.\n\nI will continue to believe in Apple and I know that your legacy will shine on in the years to come.&nbsp;","header":"RIP Steve Jobs","author":"Alastair","location":"from Victoria, Australia"}
