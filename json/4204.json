{"mainText":"I worked at Apple for 4 years at one of the retail store - something \noutside of my personality. I tend to jump around a lot from place to \nplace and try to live my life off of \"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish\" The \nculture at Apple is what kept me there. I moved on not because I didn't \nlove it or the culture or being part of innovation that truly made a \ndent in the Universe but because I chose to \" Stay Hungry and Foolish\". \nThis is part of the legacy Apple &amp; Steve had on me. To look at the \nnormal, the old, the worn down and see it differently. To always push, \nsimplify, and strip down to the essence of anything and find the beauty. \nApple embodies this, Steve embodies this and I'll always live my life by \nit.","header":"Stay Hungry.
