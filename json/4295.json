{"mainText":"Dear Apple,\n Steve Jobs was a great man who changed the world and will be remembered\nforever. Throughout history he has made ground breaking innovations that\nhave set standards so high that no-one will ever come close to, with the\nhelp of Apple. I want to thank him for all of his hard work and he did an\namazing job at what he did. I hope that he never worked a day in his life\nbecause he loved what he did. I will always remember him and always look up\nto him. Steve Jobs, thank you and rest in peace.\n","header":"R.I.P","author":"Connor","location":""}
