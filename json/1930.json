{"mainText":"As a person who has very limited understanding of technology, I want to say how much I have appreciated the tools that Steve Jobs introduced into the world.  I love my iMac.  I love my iPhone.  I love my iPod.  I love my new Apple TV.  Some day I hope to say I love my iPad!  I love knowing that when I don't understand why one of those wonderful tools isn't working, there are people on-line, or in stores, or reachable by phone who love these products and understand how to set me back on the path and are patient with my lack of understanding.\n\nAnd so I say thank you to Steve Jobs.  Here's hoping that Apple can carry on with the innovation and care.  \n\nMy condolences to the family, friends and co-workers.","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Victoria","location":""}
