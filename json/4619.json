As a former athlete turned journalist, Apple product has meant the world to me. Never will there be \nanother person to give us as a whole so much. Steve will always be what \nApple stands for - a life cut short but he gave us so much. Thank you. \nToday is a sad day in the world. He was truly the icon of many \ngenerations - the Beatles of life! Thanks for iTune, the iPad, iPad and \nMac!&nbsp;","header":"Remembering","author":"Andre","location":""}
