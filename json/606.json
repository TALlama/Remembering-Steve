{"mainText":"I was not always Steve's Jobs' fan, pushing any jealousy aside.  Sometimes I\nresented his assertion  that his way was the only way, even if he was\nsignificantly correct.\n\n \n\nIf not for Mr. Jobs, computing would have remained a stodgy magic of\ntechnical wizards, or worse, the control mechanism for big business.\nInstead he brought technology into the light, and when it was seen, it was\nbeautiful, useful, and utterly appealing.\n\n \n\nI can only hope that his legacy can be continued with his departure, as\nHumanity was better for his contribution.\n\n \n\nSo long Steve Jobs and thanks for making the world a better place.","header":"Steve Jobs Was the Right Brain of Technology","author":"Harrison","location":""}
