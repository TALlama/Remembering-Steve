{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was a super-hero to most of us.  He was the counter-culture's counter-punch.  He was a near mythical character who left a  \nfeeling of intimacy in everything he built.  When you used any Apple  \nproduct, you felt the feeling that the designer intended.  That is  \nwhat art is supposed to do.  Steve Jobs founded a school of art for  \nthe world of technology.  It is no longer Man vs. Machine.  It is no  \nlonger The Ghost in the Machine.  The bar has been set higher thanks  \nto Steve Jobs.  It is now, the Human in the Machine.  It is about  \ntechnology as a seamless extension of ourselves.  This has been  \nSteve's gift to the world.&nbsp;","header":"The counter-culture's counter-punch","author":"Joe","location":""}
