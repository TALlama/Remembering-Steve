{"mainText":"The world lost a great man today and I am deeply saddened by it. He's been such an inspiration to me in everything that I do. Steve said  \"You've got to find what you love\". There are 2 things in life that I love, Apple and Music. I am fortunate enough to have worked for Apple and I loved every minute of it, I was hired at the age of 19 and would have stayed until the day I died, but back in July, my singer and I signed a record deal with EMI Worldwide and I had to leave Apple for my other love in life, music. I wanted to let you know and everyone at Apple that when our single \"Saving Grace\" hits the airwaves, I dedicate it to Steve and the entire Apple Family. You will see us on iTunes in time.","header":"My condolences.","author":"Daniel","location":""}
