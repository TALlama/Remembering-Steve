{"mainText":"Steve was a great inspiration to me.  I liked to learn about his \nhistory, specifically how Apple was started in a garage.  I even used \nthat in my essay for applying to college.  I talked about my passion for \ntechnology and how much I was inspired by the way Steve made his way to \nthe top.  I have started my path to become a computer engineer and I \nwill always think of Steve's way of doing things as a way of pushing \nmyself forward in hopes of becoming great someday. Without Steve we \nwould not be as advanced as we are in technology today and we have a lot \nto learn from him.\n\nRest in peace Steve.  To your family and friends I am deeply sorry for \nyour loss, it's a loss to so many of us. &nbsp;","header":"RIP Steve","author":"Jake","location":""}
