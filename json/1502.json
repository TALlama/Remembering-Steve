{"mainText":"I live in a country where almost all hope is lost. Our children's education, hopes for a good future and safety and respect for life is almost zero...\nBut your struggle, your life and your constant battle for new ideas even in the worst days, gives me a new perspective and better hope for the future. \nMy heart is at a low point today. My thoughts go to your beloved wife and loved ones. Your co workers and friends. Please...take a little bit of my love and warmth from a far away place that feels closer just because of your innovative ideas! You brought the world closer..made it more like a big family.&nbsp;","header":"You...just You","author":"Rosa","location":"from Venezuela"}
