{"mainText":"Steve,\n\nThank you so much for being such an inspiration to me. I have always \nbeen envious of your style of leadership and your fearless approach to \ntaking risks in the world. Without you, my generation would not be who \nwe are today. You are the one who truly enriched lives, because without \nyour effort and genius of a mind, we would not have the amazing things \nthat we have today.\n\nYou sir, changed the world.\n\nTo the true crazy one.\n\nR.I.P.&nbsp;","header":"Steve.","author":"Jared","location":""}
