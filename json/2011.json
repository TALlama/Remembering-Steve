{"mainText":"When I was 15 I had a friend with an Apple IIe. I was blown away.....and jealous.  It was years before I could actually afford an Apple product but once\n I was able to, I have continued purchasing just about every product Apple makes. Apple has just made my life \"better\" in so many ways and I thank Steve\n Jobs for that. Thank you Steve. We will miss you.\n","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Craig","location":""}
