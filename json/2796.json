{"mainText":"Steve Jobs. The most valuable CEO in the world. This hard working, and determined man has passed away. You gave us the iPhone, and the MacBook. But you gave us more than that. You gave us hope that the future is bright and we can hold it in our hands. Rest In Peace and with every time an Apple device is used, we send our gratitude to you and to the iCloud in heaven where we and I personally hope you rest.\n\nR.I.P Steve. I didn't know you personally, but i feel like I have lost a friend. ","header":"R.I.P Steve","author":"Chamar","location":""}
