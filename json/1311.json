I have always been a great admirer of Apple products and  to learn that the person behind it died tonight is a shock to me. I want to send my deepest condolences to Steve\"s family. May his precious soul rest in perfect peace. We love u Steve!&nbsp;","header":"Rest in perfect peace","author":"Ejatu","location":""}
