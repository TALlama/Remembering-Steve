{"mainText":"I want to send my deepest condolances to Mr. Jobs' wife, children and extended \nApple family.&nbsp; How blessed we all were to be directly and indirectly affected by \nSteve Jobs and his amazing vision&nbsp;for the future and some really cool stuff.&nbsp; \nI'm 50 but I don't think I'm too old to say THANK YOU STEVE, for all the cool \nthings you've created and allowed me to experience.&nbsp; Because there is the iPad \n2, moving 2000 miles away from my family, is&nbsp;\"ok\" as you've&nbsp;created a way for&nbsp;me \nto keep in touch and see them - even my 75 yr old mom who was once afraid her \ncomputer was going to get \"an infection\" now has an Apple computer and can \nfacetime with me (a miracle).&nbsp;&nbsp; My fiance travels for weeks/months at a time and \nnow we can see each other daily.&nbsp; For that,&nbsp;I owe you huge!&nbsp; You make long \nabsences tolerable.&nbsp; You'll never know how much that has eased the pain of being \nfar away from those I love.\n&nbsp;\nWere you able to get Facetime to work in heaven so your family can continue to \nhave you close?&nbsp; I sure hope so.&nbsp; If anyone could figure out how to make that \nhappen Steve, it would be YOU!\n&nbsp;\nGOD BLESS YOU and your family!!!","header":"Steve Jobs - thanks for all you've done","author":"Dawn","location":""}
