{"mainText":"This is why i write. 4 years ago i decide to embrace the fact that \ndesign was my path. Over the years i thought that Apple was just over \nvaluated and that it was not necessary for me to embody my dreams. About \n2 years ago i couldn't help it and i bought my first mac ever, from which \nI &nbsp;am writing  this email.  Steve Jobs was from that moment one of my \ninspirations. His work, his vision of the world and the way he helped us \ndesigners to conceive our creations will always be cherish in my heart \nand in my professional life.  I hope Apple will continue the amazing \nroad steve, as a cofounder of this enterprise did until the last moment.\n\nRIP Steve Jobs. Thanks for everything.","header":"","author":"Graciela","location":""}
