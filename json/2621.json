{"mainText":"Thanks to Steve Jobs, I have been allowed to thrive as an indie filmmaker.\n I wrote my first screenplay on a Mac nearly 20 years ago.  My MacBook is\nreliable and stable and allows me to run budget, editing, and scheduling\nsoftware effortlessly... and my new 27inch iMac allows me to enjoy the\nediting tools of Final Cut Pro, the sweet codec of Apple ProRes HQ, and it's\ngreat to use with other creative applications.  So much technology is at my\nfingertips without breaking the bank.\n\nTo put it simply, Steve liberated a new generation of creative people and\nallowed greater power to the masses.  My dreams became a reality thanks to\nSteve Jobs and Team Apple.  His influence on the planet and his positive\neffect on lives makes him truly one of the most important human beings of\nthe century.\n\nThank you, Steve.&nbsp;","header":"REMEMBERING STEVE","author":"Michael&nbsp;","location":""}
