As in his \"Think Different\" campaign commercial \"The Crazy Ones\", Steve will forever be known as the man who changed the world! He will forever be missed and always live on within the hearts of so many that he has directly inspired. God Bless Steve Jobs.","header":"","author":"Bryan","location":"from Syracuse NY"}
