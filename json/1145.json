{"mainText":"I haven't always been a fan of Apple products, being a PC user from around 5\nyears old (I'm almost 33 now) and having only recently converted to a\nMacBook Pro, but you can't deny all that he's done for the computer industry\nas a whole.  Some of my fondest memories as a kid were using the old Apple\nII systems at school, learning how to type, playing Oregon Trail, writing\nsmall programs in BASIC, and everything else we did.  From his ideas, to his\ncharisma, you could always tell his true excitement in talking about and\nreleasing new products.  He was a true pioneer in his field and he will be\ngreatly missed.","header":"He will be missed","author":"Jeremy","location":""}
