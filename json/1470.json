{"mainText":"Steve Jobs RIP! Steve Jobs is always going be Apple.\n\nI had a iPod, a Nano, on my second iPhone and have MacBook Pro. I guess you\ncan say I'm a Apple person.\n\nThe thing I'm always going remember Steve Jobs the most is the iPod. You can\nhold thousands of songs in the palm of your hand, it weighed about 2 and a\nhalf pounds or less. You do not have to be bother with cassette tapes or CD's\nanymore.  If this do not make Steve Jobs a genius, nothing will. I enjoy my\nMac Book Pro and I would never give up my iPhone. I'm always in people face\nsaying \"I got the best cell phone in the world.\" All because of Steve Jobs.\n\nMy prayers go out to steve Jobs family. Steve Jobs you are truly going to be\nmissed, but never forgotten. You do have your place in History.","header":"Thanks Steve Jobs.","author":"Phyllis","location":""}
