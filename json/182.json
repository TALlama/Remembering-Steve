{"mainText":"\nI remember the days when the Internet was dial-up; the days it took minutes to load a screen.\nI remember running to class hoping to be the first in lab to get the computer I desired.\nI remember the day I woke up on a bright sunny morning, snow outside, and the fireplace crackling.\nI remember the joy I felt on Christmas Day, the unwrapping of presents and the smell of delicious breakfast awaiting.\nI remember the moment my eyes caught a glimpse of a large box awaiting behind my parent's back, that Christmas morning.\n\nThey say the last gift you receive is something meaningful, no matter the size of the box.\nI never believed in it...\nI remember the moment my hands laid on my first Apple; a strong joyous feeling I will never forget.\nAnd I will always remember the person who was behind it all, Steve Jobs, who not only changed my life for the better, but better for the lives out there.&nbsp;","header":"Steve, the one who changed my life.","author":"Hiro","location":""}
