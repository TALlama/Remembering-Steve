{"mainText":"My condolences go out to Mr Jobs' family and friends; The world has lost an amazing person. I would like to thank Steve for all his work in making Apple what it is today. I made the Apple switch (from PC) years ago as a young teenager, and I have never looked back.\nFrom starting with a small and simple ipod mini, then moving to an ipod video, ipod classic, ipod touch....and now iphone4; I must say I have never once been disappointed. Same story with my first mac (mac mini) and my now current iMac. \n\nI LOVE Apple, please don't stop doing what you do best, keep up the fantastic work.\n\nRest in Peace Steve Jobs.&nbsp;","header":"Condolences","author":"Matt","location":""}
