{"mainText":"To those those who knew Steve, and his family, you have my deepest sympathy. Steve Jobs wasn't just some 'Big Wig' of a company, he had visions, dreams, aspirations and goals. He achieved them, he stuck with his gut when he was young and it brought him to be the fore-front of a large industry. He was an inspiration to many people who sought to make something of themselves, I know I did. Steve created a revolutionary world for music when iTunes and the iPod came into light and forever changed how we saw music and videos. When the youth of today thinks of music, ninety percent of them have iPod on their mind. He created something that will last many lifetimes to come. Steve left behind shoes that no one can fill, but I'm sure someone will do well. Again, I'm sorry for the loss of a great man, and to Steve, wherever you may be... Thanks so much for the entertainment that I got from your company.","header":"To anyone who knew Steve.","author":"Evan","location":""}
