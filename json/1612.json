{"mainText":"I was not ever lucky enough to meet Steve in person, but today I almost feel\nlike I've lost a friend. Nobody I know can deny the impact Steve Jobs has\nmade in his short time on Earth. For me, I have considered Steve a role\nmodel for many years. I can truly say I've never watched as many CEOs\ndeliver products, keynotes, or speeches as well and as intelligently as\nSteve had. I admire Steve not only because he created countless\ninspirational, revolutionary, and paradigm-shifting products, but because he\nhad the courage to follow his dreams and create multiple companies that have\nchanged the way we all look at the world. To quote Apple's \"Think Different\"\ncampaign, \"Hereâ€™s to the crazy ones. The rebels. The troublemakers. The ones\nwho see things differently. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we\nsee genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change\nthe world, are the ones who do.\" Rest in peace, Steve. I hope you know what\nan amazing and inspirational legacy you have left behind.","header":"My memoir","author":"Justin","location":""}
