{"mainText":"I never needed to personally know Steve Jobs. I feel lucky to be alive when he was on this earth and have felt the creative genius Steve gave the world in my first experience with the Apple IIe. I've been with Apple ever since, from the IIc and a succession of products to our current MacBook Pro and iPad products. My next purchase will be the Job's inspired iPhone. His imprint is on the succession of products and companies throughout the years, including Pixar. He's made the world a better place in an infinite number of ways. To infinity and beyond, Steve. \n","header":"At a loss for words","author":"Peter","location":""}
