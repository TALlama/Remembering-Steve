{"mainText":"The brain child of Steve jobs, Apple Inc. has changed my life in many \nways.  My first computer was an Apple IIGs my father bought second hand \nwhen I was 9.  It opened the doors of computing to me and stimulated my \ninterest in technology.  For a while after I was inundated with PC's in \nschool and at home.  Apple had become foreign to me.  When I was 19 I \ngot a job at a small concrete precaster business where all the computers \nwere Imacs, things just worked well in that office - largely due to the \nfunctionality and ease of use of Apple computers.  When I got accepted \nto Cornell University in 2007 and left my job the first thing I did was \npurchase a MacBook Pro with the help of my grandfather, the very \ncomputer I am typing this on today.  I will never go back to a PC.  \nSteve Jobs, you have changed my life for the better with your ideas, \nproducts, and spirit.  Thank you.  RIP.&nbsp;","header":"Steve's Impact on My Life","author":"Thomas","location":""}
