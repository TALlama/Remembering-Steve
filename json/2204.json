It was a train  \nthat you had to jump onâ€“or get left behind. I jumped and have never  \nlooked back. Every day, every project, every computer...it's been a  \nlove and a joy. Thanks Steve and every one at Apple. Please keep the  \ntrain rolling!&nbsp;","header":"challenge for the future","author":"Sandra","location":""}
