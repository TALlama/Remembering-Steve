{"mainText":"My sincerest condolences go out to Steve's family and friends. Steve Jobs  \nwas an inspiration to me, he created a company like no other, one that  \nother manufacturers seriously envied. He put the smartphone on the map and  \nreinvented the MP3 player. A true genius and one that will always be  \nremembered and respected by me.\n\nRest In Peace Steve.","header":"My sincerest condolences","author":"Nick","location":""}
