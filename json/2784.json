{"mainText":"Dear Apple, I'm so sad to hear of Steve Jobs' passing. I want to share some of my memories of watching the macintosh evolve over the years. As a kid, I used to go to Montgomery Wards and play with the Macintosh that was on display. The very first program was one where I could draw and use brushes (it was in the late 80s, early 90s), and was very impressed with it. Unfortunately, my family couldn't afford it at the time so I wen\nt to that same computer every time I visited the store until it was gone. &nbsp;Montgomery Ward closed completely in the late 90s and no other store carried an Apple product. I moved on to use the computers at school, but none \nof them impressed me like that Macintosh did at Montgomery Ward. I didn't really think about having a computer of my own until I got to community college in 2006 (which made me a non traditional student). It was the end\n of the fall semester when I found out that I could get a discount for a computer. I remembered that computer from Montgomery Ward and decided tha\nt my first computer would be an iMac. It took a couple of weeks and a cab\n ride home (I don't have a car), I got it home. I also got an iPod Nano \n2nd Generation a day before the new one came. They're still with me, eve\nn though the iMac got electrocuted and I had to replace the hard drive, and\n I got iPod classic to make room for more songs, and a Macbook Pro to help \nout with my new school. Thanks to you, I got my Associates and I'm a year away from getting my Bachelor Degree. I hope to pass these down when I \nhave my own family someday. Everyone will miss you Mr. Jobs, and know \nthat you made a lot of people's lives better. Ever since I saw that Macintosh at Montgomery Wards and that drawing program as a little girl, I knew\n that I was going to buy an Apple computer. Thank you for everything.","header":"Thank you for helping me get my degree!","author":"Chakusola","location":""}
