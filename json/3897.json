{"mainText":"I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have lived in the same day and \nage as Steve Jobs. Because of him, I know for certain that a lone man with vision, \ntenacity, focus, and a sense of purpose can indeed change the world. I am humbled.....and this day, immeasurably sad. My heart breaks for his wife and children, as I cannot imagine the depth \nof their grief this day.\n\nRIP and Godspeed, Steve Jobs. Thank you for inspiring me in more ways \nthan any words could adequately describe. &nbsp;We will miss you.&nbsp;","header":"thank you","author":"Courtney","location":""}
