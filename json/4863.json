{"mainText":"To the Jobs, and Apple families,\n\nToday I was deeply saddened by the news that Steve Jobs had passed away. I\nnever met Steve but he was, and will always be an important part of my life.\nI supported a family and raised four children working as an artist in front\nof my Mac. Over the years I have kept my cherished family photos with\niPhoto, wrote love songs with GarageBand, captured precious moments in time\nwith iMovie, and listened to countless hours of inspiring music with iTunes.\nAnd now that my children have grown and make their way in the world, I wish\nthem well, and tell them how much I love them via text on my iPhone. Without\nSteve's vision none of this would have been possible, and for that I am\neternally grateful. To a man who has given me so much over the years I have\none word, iPeace.\n\nMy heartfelt condolences to Steve's immediate and extended families.\n","header":"iPeace","author":"George","location":""}
