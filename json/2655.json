{"mainText":"Steve has always been an inspiration to me, to work harder to better the world I live and work in. And he will continue to represent that in my life. In a way he'll live on through Apple, a company that is as much a part of him as he was of it.&nbsp;\nI hope that everybody at Apple will always remember what he stood for and continue to do things \"the Steve way\".&nbsp;\nApple has changed my life in more ways than one, and Steve has inspired me along the way. I will forever remember Steve as the legendary leader of Apple who helped to give us a better future for technology.","header":"A Legendary Leader","author":"Nate","location":""}
