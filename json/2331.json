{"mainText":"When Apple computers were released years ago, my Papa was an instant supporter and fan. He taught me from a very young age to use Apples, and has always jumped to get the \"latest and greatest\" of their creations. You will never meet another 73 year old more in love with Apple! Steve Jobs was the most amazing creator of our time. He has inspired so many to follow their own dreams. He has taught me that nothing is unobtainable. Thank you, Steve, for everything. May God bless those in their time of mourning. \n","header":"","author":"Anna","location":""}
