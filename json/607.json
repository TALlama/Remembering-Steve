{"mainText":"To hear about the passing of Steve Jobs has really put me in a state of pain and mourn. Since 2002 Steve Jobs has been my idol, it wasn't only till last year I realized because of him I wanted to be a technological genius. Apple has lost a valuable piece of the company, the CEO and the mastermind. My dream was to meet Steve Jobs and tell him thank you for making me the person that I am and want to be, but I guess its too late. I will always have Steve Jobs in my heart as I move out of middle school, to high school, to college, and even when I start my own technological company. I know Steve is looking at us from above and will always protect Apple Inc. Steve Jobs: A genius; a mastermind; a visionary MY IDOL! THANK YOU STEVE!","header":"","author":"Krystal","location":""}
