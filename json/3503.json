Now I am 38 and father of two children who cherish Steve's vision, we as a family enjoy all that Pixar has created and both in home and work rely on and savor the idea of using our Ipad's , Iphone's, Ipod's, MacBook's, Mac Mini's and Xserve.\n\nThank you Steve, your genius, your ability to think outside the box, your willingness to push the limits have made our lives much better and have pushed the whole industry forward. \nWe hold your memory close to our hearts ","header":"In memory of Steve Jobs","author":"Ivan","location":""}
