{"mainText":"When I was first introduced to the wonderful world of technological advances of our era, I quickly saw Apple had something special: a founder who truly and deeply cared for the quality of the services he provided.&nbsp; I quickly came to admire Steve Jobs as a man who loved what he gave the world, and took pride in it.&nbsp; I was 13 then and though I am only 17 and soon to be entering the world, I know that if there are men like Steve Jobs in this world, I have hope for it.&nbsp; As a future business man, Steve Jobs is and always will be an idol to me.&nbsp; He revolutionized the world, and it has just begun.&nbsp; He has helped advance the world, a world I am proud to inherit.&nbsp; I will try to achieve his genuine passion for what he did and live up to the legacy he has left behind for all business people, and people in general, to see.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\nTo a Great Man. Take care Mr. Jobs.&nbsp; I am saddened that I am to never meet you, but heartened that you live on in the hearts and minds of all people left here.&nbsp;\nMy Condolences to the Jobs Family.&nbsp;","header":"Memories","author":"Siddhartha","location":""}
