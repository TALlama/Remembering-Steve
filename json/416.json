{"mainText":"One footnote to Steve Jobs' amazing life was his startup effort between stints at Apple - the NeXt operating system.  My company was an early adopter.  Steve came to speak to us in one of his famous presentations.  When asked how\n this system could do what he promised, Steve answered, \" It just works.\". And it did.  The system was way ahead of its time. One neat feature was the ability to send embedded voice messages by clicking on an icon of lips.  You could also easily edit sound files, rearranging words.  This facilitated the ability to send a spoken urgent command from the CEO to come to his office (totally concocted from prior messages from the CEO).  This little anecdote highlights the fact that Steve brought a spirit of play to his products, a spirit that acknowledged that he was making machines for human beings that helped facilitate human creativity.&nbsp;","header":"Next","author":"Barbara","location":""}
