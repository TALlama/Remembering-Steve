{"mainText":"I was shocked nevertheless to see the message on the homepage even\nthough it was expected. Somehow, because Steve had wildly succeeded\nwith a second act at Apple I was also hoping it would be the same with\nlife. The world has truly lost an amazing person. I have never met him\nbut he has inspired me, made me more knowledgeable and my life easier,\nmore creative. For that I thank him from the bottom of my heart. RIP\nSteve.\n","header":"RIP Steve","author":"Sharon","location":""}
