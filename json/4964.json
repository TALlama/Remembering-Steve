{"mainText":"I just bought my first iMac computer. I love Apple products and think they are absolutely amazing. As Jacque Fresco of The Venus Project states \"all technology is just a pile of junk, unless it truly helps humans live a better life\" I truly felt that with Steve Jobs' incredibly innovative insight Apple was and is the only electronics company that made hardware that indeed, improves the quality of life. From ceo's to people with disabilities using the multi-touch programming on the iPad, the multi-touch gestures and universal access for disabled people. It turned there products into almost, \"one size fits all\" hardware devices. Steve Jobs was truly a design genius, and will be sorely missed in this ever advancing technological world.","header":"In Memorandum","author":"Jory","location":""}
