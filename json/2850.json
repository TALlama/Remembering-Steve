{"mainText":"To Steve Jobs and his family,\n\nI am an 18 year old college student. I have never met Steve Jobs nor any of\nhis members of his family. But tonight, I am moved by his passing after his\nstruggle with cancer. His work has irreversibly changed my life in so many\nways. The man's genius and his guidance of the Apple company and it's\nproducts has forever changed my view of technology and will affect my life\nfor years to come. Tonight, the world has lost one of its greatest minds.\nThank you for everything you have done Steve Jobs, your name will live on\nthrough the ages.&nbsp;","header":"Condolences","author":"Corbin","location":""}
