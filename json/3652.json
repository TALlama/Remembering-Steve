{"mainText":"Dear Apple,\n\nI think I was especially emotional because I felt that Steve was \"taken\" from us.  When a person could have so many more years with so many more contributions to the world left within him, there is a true loss when his life is cut short before his time.  That said, there is no question that he has had an incredibly rich impact on so many people and the time he had on earth was full of meaning.  I was thinking about how he really had a deep commitment to making great products, and really cared about quality.  And his vision democratized computing for multiple generations of creative people, which forever is changing our music, art, design, and film.  Thank you Steve for what you have brought to this world, and I really wish you were still here.","header":"He will be missed","author":"Matt","location":"from New York"}
