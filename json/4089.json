{"mainText":"I remember not knowing very much about Apple products, until I saw my \nfirst Mac computer late in 2007.  It was on display in a store, and I \nknew immediately that I had to have one.  I was absolutely enthralled \nwith it  I have since owned two, and I have loved each one of them.  I \nhave also owned 2 different iPhones, and a number if iPods. Steve Jobs was a genius, to say the very, very least.  The world has \nlost a brilliant inventor,  marketer, and a wonderful person.  He will \nbe forever missed.  Rest in Peace Steve.","header":"Online Condolence","author":"David","location":"from Phoenix, Arizona"}
