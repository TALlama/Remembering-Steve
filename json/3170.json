{"mainText":"Although I was late to the Computer world. I first dipped my toes into the Apple pool in 1997. I have been a dedicated user and follower ever since. Apple products have changed the way I have lived my life and continue to affect my children and friends. \nToday I was very sad to have learned of Steve's passing. He has affected us all whether you choose to acknowledge that or not. A modern day Icon his memory will live on and inspire us all.\nHe will be truly missed. To think that a lot of listen to music and communicate in a way we might never have without him. Amazing!\nMy thoughts are with his family and friends and this very sad time.","header":"Icon","author":"Michael","location":""}
