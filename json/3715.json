{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\n\nI grew up in a world where there were no computers, no internet, no email,\nno connectivity or information sharing.\nMy kids don't.  You and other brilliant people made the world different with\ncomputers.\nYOU made the world different by insisting on a higher quality, on better\nproducts, on creating the wave of change.\nYou made the difference by creating, losing and coming back and creating\nand winning again.\nI can tell my kids, there is no limit, there is no failure- look at Steve\nJobs.\nThe world has lost someone really special.\nMay your soul rest in peace knowing that you've done so much for so many.\nOur thoughts and prayers go out to your wife and children in their profound\nloss.&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs- He made a world of difference","author":"&nbsp;Akhila","location":"from India"}
