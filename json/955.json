{"mainText":"His innovation in personal computer back the 1980s inspired me to embark\nonto a wonderful career in IT.  I can vividly remember when I started\nkindergarten in the fall of 1986, the Apple IIe was the first computer I\never saw in my life then.  Being a little boy with a strong curiosity like a\ncat really drove me to sneak over and press a key to see what happens next.\n I even mistaken the monitor as a small ordinary TV.  Throughout my years in\ngrade school, Apple Computers especially the Macintosh were my only favorite\ncomputers that I have depended on heavily on many occasions and I was\nheavily defending the Macworld side throughout the 1990s as a teenager.\n Even when college required me to convert to PCs, I continue to remember and\nappreciate the legend that Apple Computers have done to inspire me to be one\nof many successful IT professionals to this day and I can only credit Steve\nJobs for all the inspirations he had given me with his wonderful innovations\nin personal computers.\n","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"David","location":""}
