I heard the news from an app on my iPad, \ntext some of my friends about it on my iPhone, read the news on my \nMacbook air, and am typing this email on my iMac. I use, love, and \nappreciate the incredible products that Mr. Jobs and Apple create and as \ndeeply saddened as I am by the news, I have faith that Apple will \ncontinue to thrive as a company that has and always will make him proud. \nI am so sorry for his family's loss. RIP Mr. Jobs.\n","header":"Mr. Jobs","author":"Jeremy","location":""}
