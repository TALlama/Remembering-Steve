{"mainText":"\nDear Steve's family,\n                R.I.P to the death of Steve Jobs.\n                I am a girl from China and study in Purdue University right now. I was using Apple products when I was in junior high. You have no idea how much i love them ever since. After using first Ipod nano, I start to collect them for example, I got shuffle, Ipad, new version of nano, classic, Iphone, mac air and even my whole family are using Iphone. Also I am planning on buying Iphone 4s on 14th of October. I know that Steve's death would bring sorrow even shadows into your family but I really hope your family can get through this. You should know there are zillions of people love Apple. \n                Just so you know, Steve has been my role model for years and he will always be. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;","header":"Addicted to Apple Products","author":"Qi","location":""}
