{"mainText":"I understand the loss of seeing someone you love and admire lose their\nstrength, both mentally and physically. My heart goes out to Steve's family,\nboth personal and company.\n\nMy Father passed away on June 17, 2011 from Cancer. When I last spoke with\nmy Father, took images, video and audio of him, it was with an iPhone 3GS.\nWe were estranged for so long and the Flip camera I used last year to get\nvideo of him stopped working as soon as I got home. I still haven't seen\nthat footage but Apple made it possible for me to see him today and every\nday.\n\nPeople talk about how he made gadgets sleek and beautiful. For me, it was\nthe integration which changed my life. His innovation empowered users.\n\nThank you.","header":"My Condolences","author":"Melina","location":""}
