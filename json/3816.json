{"mainText":"I remember my first computer an Apple Performa back in 95. I remember\nbecoming a fanboy from the first days in Graphic Design class. I remember\nall the heated arguments with friends, colleagues and even bosses about the\nMac's superiority and how I wasn't going to work on anything but a Mac.\n\nI happened to fall into fixing the mac's at an old job and maintaining two\nservers. I unwillingly became the Mac teach, event getting a Mac cert. I now\nmanage a large website for a great organisation and if it wasn't for\nthose experiences I wouldn't know half of what I now understand about\ncomputers.\n\nThank you Steve, the technology industry has lost it's shepard.&nbsp;","header":"Mac Fan","author":"Rick","location":""}
