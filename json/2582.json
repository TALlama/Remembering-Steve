{"mainText":"Steve Jobs didn't change modern technology. He defined modern \ntechnology. I've never met Steve Jobs, but I feel close to him. His death affects me in an emotional way. I am shocked and saddened. I wish only the best upon his family. May the legacy of Steve Jobs last forever, and may Apple continue to \nbe the company that he intended it to be. Rest in peace, Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;","header":"Re:","author":"Edmund","location":""}
