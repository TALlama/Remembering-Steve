{"mainText":"Steve, you made a difference around the world. You made technology fun and easy and amazing. The terms Computer Geek and Nerd no longer have the same connotation because of you. I met my husband at a Mac User Group decades ago and my world is filled with products from your mind. You have had an impact on my life and you will be missed. Sorry this day has come so soon. Thank you for all of your contributions and your inspiration.","header":"You'll be missed","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
