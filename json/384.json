{"mainText":"I had never had the pleasure of knowing Steve Jobs but  I was asked a \nquestion on a site recently that asked if I could have dinner with 3 \npeople who would it be. My first choice was Steve Jobs. The man's vision \ntowards the future allowed him to see the turn of technology before so \nmany of us could, even  in our wildest dreams. I consider myself an \n\"Apple Man\" to which I can only feel as if that means being a son of \nSteve. His passion was our passion. His vision was the twinkle in our \neyes as we gazed at heavens never before seen. I think that if passion \nwas life then he has lived a thousand lifetimes and in all we should be \nenvious of him for it, but we should never feel at a loss because that \npassion that he exuded was spread in waves throughout the world and that \nwas what made him such a great man that we could feel. When he stood up \nto speak all the world inhaled and held their breaths, our eyes widened \nand our hearts soared. Steve wasn't a man that none of us knew. He was a \nman that showed us a dream and handed it to us. As we all feel as if \nwe've lost our father, mentor, friend, let us not forget that passion \nthat he felt and shared. Let us feel that as we look onward towards the \nfuture and remember him by taking that passion and building a better \nworld. The one that Steve saw.","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
