{"mainText":"Though I was not fortunate enough to know Steve, I was lucky enough to own his products. Though I am both technologically ignorant and not business-saavy, I recognized early on that Steve Jobs was the creative force and inspiring visionary behind the most elegant and user-friendly computers on earth. I became an Apple investor in 1997 and my very small investment grew to become the foundation of my retirement account. I thank Mr. Jobs and Apple for helping me that way! But most of all, tonight, on hearing this sad news, I offer my sincerest condolences to Steve's family and friends, and that includes the legions of loyal Apple employees. God Bless You Steve Jobs and God Speed. ","header":"A note of condolence","author":"Walli","location":""}
