{"mainText":"Steve Jobs is truly someone phenomenal. He has not only changed my life \ndirectly, teaching me how to live my own, he has changed the lives of \nbillions around the world - Whether you're playing your favorite song on \nyour iPod, trying to complete that impossible level on Angry Birds, \nsurfing the net for information for your next term paper or spending an \nevening watching a rerun of Toy Story on TV, this man has touched your \nheart in one way or another. I still remembered telling my mother how much I wanted that iPod Mini \nback in 2004, my first Apple product, where I told her it would change \nhow I listened to my music forever, allowing me to carry my entire music \nlibrary, my source of relaxation and enjoyment. Now, 7 years on and a \nthousand more songs later, this iPod has not only changed how I listen \nto music, but how I listen to my life. Thank you Steve, for having the privilege to say that I've lived in a \ntime of difference, imagination and hunger.","header":"Thank you for the music, technology and inspiration.","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
