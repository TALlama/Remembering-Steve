{"mainText":"Apple, personified by Steve Jobs, has been a decades-long influence on both my work and home lives in ways that have become so integral that I could not imagine how different it would have been without it.\nWhile I'm sure that Apple will continue to lead and innovate, and no doubt succeed, I will miss having what I've always felt to be a connection with the soul of the company.\nMy career as a graphic designer began before Macintosh, and when it arrived it seemed to confirm that there was someone in the computer world who shared the way creative people think.\nSome of the best memories I have were waiting for Steve to take the stage for MacWorld's keynote, and have him amaze us with just one more glimpse of a future that was starting at that moment.\nI am glad that he was able to see Apple flourish under his leadership, and to know the appreciation that users everywhere had for his contribution to the technology that enriches our lives.","header":"Steve","author":"Dan","location":""}
