{"mainText":"I've never met Steve Jobs in person. But everyday I thank him for everything\nhe changed in my life.\n\nSince I started buying Apple products, I had 3 iPods, 2 laptops, one iMac,\none iPad, and 3 iPhones. And they made my life easier.\n\nBut Steve changed many more. He changed the industry from music to phones.\nAnd that wasn't his biggest contribution either.\n\nHe was a model for everyone. After I heard his speech on Stanford (the most\ninspiring ever), I saw how many issues he had on his life, but that wasn't\nenough to stop him from doing what he wanted. And he changed the world.\n\nThank you, not only for the amazing stuff you created and made technology\nsimple. Thanks for showing us that you don't have to be a show off to be\ngreat. You can do all that on a turtle neck and jeans.","header":"Thank you, Steve","author":"Luiz&nbsp;","location":"from Bras√≠lia, Brazil"}
