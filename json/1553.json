{"mainText":"To see the looks on my 7 and 8 year old student's faces when they touch, hold, and use the ipad, gives me chills.  I am so blessed to be able to do two jobs that I'm so passionate about and intertwine them together.  This is all due to Steve Jobs.  I am a teacher and an Apple employee.  He will always be the man who saw a dream and went for it.  A dream that has forever changed the world for the better.  I am so grateful to be a part of such an extraordinary company created and perfected by him.  I send my deepest condolences to his family, friends, and Apple family.  He will truly be missed but always remembered.&nbsp;","header":"","author":"Nicole","location":""}
