{"mainText":"I remember the Think Different posters! We decorated all of our school's \ncomputer labs with them. I think we need one now with Steve and Woz on \nit.\n\nI'd also like to thank Steve for coming back to Apple. The day his \nreturn was announced, I bought stock. I couldn't afford much, but that \nstock put my youngest daughter through her four years of college. I \nstill have nine shares left. Steve's vision and his ability to enable other people's visions changed \nthe world. Thanks, Steve.","header":"Think Different Posters","author":"Gretchen","location":""}
