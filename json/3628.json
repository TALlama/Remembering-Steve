{"mainText":"From my first Apple 2C in 1981 to my IPad 2 I purchased this year I have felt like a part of this company.

I will always be an Apple customer and I am sure that the innovations and dreams of Steve Jobs will be carried on forever.  I'll miss you Steve RIP.","header":"A great man is lost.","author":"Steve","location":""}
