{"mainText":"The day my partner replaced her desktop PC with an iMac in the mid-2000s it changed her life. Several iPhones and desktops and laptops later in our home and her family's homes and soon a likely iPad for my parents who have yet to join the online world, we are so very grateful. Steve Jobs brought us amazing\n worlds and fun and ease with his visionary genius. Rest in peace Steve - you will be sorely missed and forever admired and appreciated.","header":"Thank you Steve","author":"Karen","location":"from Baltimore"}
