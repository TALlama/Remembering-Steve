{"mainText":"My heartfelt condolences to Mr. Jobs' family. I am and have always been an Apple computer devotee. If I did not have a Mac, I would not have a computer, and I use a computer for everything. I am 53 years old, so I have watched the remarkable things Steve Jobs did for Apple from the beginning, and I really like his style. The world is less without him, may he rest in peace.&nbsp;","header":"Condolence","author":"Beejay","location":"from Wilmington, NC"}
