{"mainText":"I was shocked and very saddened to hear of the loss of one of the greatest minds of this age. Although I never knew Steve Jobs personally, his influence has made a tremendous impact on my day to day life. I have become in my area (Philadelphia Metro) as the \"iPostle\" since\nI crossed over from PC to Mac user in 2007. I not only own multiple iDevices and Apple computers, but I managed to convert many of my friends and family to do the same, here in the US and in Europe. I used to kid around with friends saying that \"Steve Jobs owes me money...\" but in reality, I owe him a lot of kudos for making my life a whole lot easier. I always looked forward to his new product presentations at Keynote. I was also shocked when he stepped down as CEO a few weeks ago. Mr. Jobs' shoes will be very difficult to fill. I will never forget him. May his ideals and influence live on for ages to come.&nbsp;","header":"Condolences for Steve","author":"Rodney","location":""}
