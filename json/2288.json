{"mainText":"I am a Chinese, its hard to get apple products since there was just 1 apple\nstore within whole country. I always read news from apple, and finally I got\na ipod when I traveled to Hongkong. I hold the ipod, feeling like hold\nsomething in the future. I don’t know when I started to believe all the\napple products come from the future, but I deeply believe that. I think Steve is an amazing man, he just made the products that all others were\ndreaming about, even not in the dream. He said to one ceo:” come with me and\nwe change the world.” Although the ceo didn’t, he did. He said that then he\ndid it. I even fear to say that.\n\nEvery time he showed up, he brought the perfect products to the world, I\nrather call them arts. Look things around me, Macbook, iPod, iPhone3g 3gs, 4,\niPad 1,2. I used to have these, now I am very sad, cause the man who\nbrought these to me left this world.\n\nI believe he can change the world up there as well.\n","header":"the man showed the future","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
