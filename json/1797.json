{"mainText":"A great leader in life has passed. He taught all of us that we could trust a\ngain, we could trust a vision shared by so many across the world. Apple is not a company, it's a family of creative, innovative, honest human beings striving to bring this world together through technology. That's the bridge Steve had created for the Apple family and the millions of people yet to become\n part of the Apple family. A legacy that few have left remains as a result of Steve's vision. Every member of the Apple family must come together and continue the broadcast of Steve's vision to the world. We are more alike than we know, Steve believed everyone could share an Apple. Thank you Steve for showing us how much we can accomplish. May God give you peace and watch over your family.\n\nBless you Steve.&nbsp;","header":"Bless you Steve","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
