{"mainText":"I started with an Atari 800 in the early 80's. My wife worked at a computer store and brought home the first Mac before they went on sale. This engaged me in the \"computer world\" and did more to advance my career than any other\n single thing. It allowed me to write spreadsheets to better manage operatio\nns at my company. I have Steve Jobs and Apple to thank for me being able to give my family a life they might not otherwise had. He not only did this for me but multitudes of other people. He will be known as the most significant person of my generation.","header":"My memories","author":"Jim","location":""}
