{"mainText":"I had to save my money for awhile to buy my first (functional) home computer in kit form.  I then had to save my money once again, to buy an Apple II+ when they became available.  The Apple II+ was not my first home computer, in fact it was my third, but it was my first home computer to actually be generally useful, while being intrinsically thrilling.  When the Mac became available I had to save my money once again.    It's been a great experience.\nGodspeed Steve.\n\n","header":"The Thrill of the Early Home Computers","author":"Art","location":""}
