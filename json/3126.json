{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was my contemporary.  I'm a few years younger but found my career and love of technology by learning to program on the Apple IIe my father bought for me in the early 80's.   To me, Steve Jobs is synonymous with the era of technology in which I grew up and that which so rapidly advanced the world as we know it today.  I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Jobs on several occasions over the years -- most memorably when he introduced his Next computer in Cambridge at a Lotus Developers conference and at several of the annual Siggraph conferences where he introduced Pixar, Renderman and John Lasseter.  It saddens me to hear of his untimely passing.  I wish to express my sincere condolences to his family and hope they find happiness again soon.  Rest in peace Mr. Jobs. And thank you.&nbsp;","header":"Remembering Steve Jobs","author":"Heide","location":"from New York City"}
