{"mainText":"I didn't always know about Steve Jobs, but once I did, there was no looking back. Even from afar his charisma, personality, and genius seem to consume you in awe. His contribution to technology past, present, and future is immeasurable and\n he will be missed dearly. Best wishes for his family who has to live with the loss much more than we.I sincerely hope that Apple never forgets his \"simple\" touch. Continue to in\nspire and innovate, I'm sure that's what Steve would have wanted.  Thank you\n Steve Jobs.","header":"Thank You","author":"Howard","location":""}
