Indeed this is a dark day for us Apple fans here in Zimbabwe    We never thought we will live to see this day.  It was our hope that your sickness was a passing phase. Although you passed away like this, we gain solace in the fact that your name is forever associated with success and what hard work can do.  You left an\n undying legacy and a living testimony of what commitment means in the form of Apple Inc. We will miss you, but  one day we trust we will meet in a better world.&nbsp;","header":"This is indeed a sad day for all","author":"Ishe","location":""}
