With my first job doing tech support for Apple, to now supporting the International Space Station as a Mac Expert, you have helped pave the way to a better way of life, more ways than you can think of. You have changed the way the world views technology. Thank you for all you have done. You will be missed, but your legacy will never fade.\n\nRIP boss.","header":"Thank You Steve!","author":"John","location":""}
