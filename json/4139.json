{"mainText":"Hello,\n\nMy deepest condolences and prayers&nbsp;go out to the Jobs family, Apple and \nPixar.&nbsp;I am saddened to hear about Mr. Jobs passing. I have been an \nApple user since 2006. I know what it is like to lose someone with \ncancer.&nbsp;My mother passed away in June 1991 at&nbsp;the age of 51 of cancer. I think the most significant thing I will remember about&nbsp;Mr. Jobs, is \nhis obvious contributions to how we live our lives and perform our jobs. \nIf it weren't for the advancements in technology though his visions, our \nlives would be significantly different. And a thank you to those that \nworked so hard to make his visions come to life. Steve Jobs will be \nmissed.&nbsp;Thank you Steve. You will be missed.","header":"Sad Day","author":"Jody","location":""}
