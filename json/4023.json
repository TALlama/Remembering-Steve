{"mainText":"These are the numbers of years I've been using Apple's products. It all \nstarted with a Macintosh Performa in 1996, first computer the family \nbought. I was 6. I was in my home city, Lyon, France.\nNow I've got my own MacBook, and I'm an iPhone developer for a company \nin London.\n\nSomehow, Steve Jobs has built things that my whole life have been \nsurrounded with and I owe him my passion and my work.\nI never meet him, nor talk to him. I wish I had. I'm sad.\n\nI thank everybody at Apple for having made the world a better place \nthanks to incredible products, always right and trustworthy. I send you \nall my best thoughts to continue without Steve. To produce great \nsoftware and products that... that just fit.&nbsp;","header":"1996 - 2011, and counting","author":"Baldoph","location":"from London"}
