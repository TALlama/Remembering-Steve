{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was the man who built and ran the only company I would ever \nbuy an OEM computer from, and have many times over.  I have worn the \nApple logo on every vehicle I have owned, every desktop I have built, \nand even stuck one on my MacBook.  One time I bought another copy of OSX \nSnow Leopard so I could get another sticker to put on something.  This \nis a dark time for all Apple supporters, and even more so for every \ncomputer enthusiast worldwide.  From the bottom of my heart you will \nalways be missed.","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Adam","location":"from Fort Bragg, NC"}
