{"mainText":"Although I haven't purchased much from the Apple company, when I heard of Steve Jobs' passing, it hit me that the world had truly lost a brilliant man. What we haven't lost, though, is his story, his strong will to keep fighting, and a legacy that\nwill surely live on. Steve Jobs has made history and has left his footprint on the world. RIP, and my sincerest condolences to Mr. Jobs' family.","header":"RIP Steve Jobs","author":"Hina","location":""}
