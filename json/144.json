{"mainText":"For all my life I have heard about Steve Jobs as if  he was some changeless\nfact of Universe. So it really feels strange to hear he has  passed away\nand, though my interest about him has never been beyond my school books, I\nfeel really sad to know that such a genius and special man is not among us\nanymore. Steve Jobs was an alive legend and his departure from this world\nsurely leaves a sense of emptiness. To his family and friends, I would like\nto say that I am sorry and that I wish him to rest in peace.\n\n\n\n\n                                                With all my respect and\n admiration","header":"An Alive Legend Left Us","author":"Rafaela","location":"from Brazil"}
