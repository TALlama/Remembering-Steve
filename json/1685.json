{"mainText":"A sad day. I first typed a college term paper on an Apple II in 1984.   \nHave used many Apple products since then. Having constant internet access  \nthrough the iphone 4 I carry around seems so inevitable now that without it I  \nwould feel I'd lost a piece of my brain.  I guess that's the mark of a  \nvisionary product.\n \nIt's kind of heartbreaking to think of all the things that won't get  \ninvented now.","header":"Thanks, Steve.","author":"Elizabeth","location":""}
