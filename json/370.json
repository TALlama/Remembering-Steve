{"mainText":"I just watched a clip of a speech Mr. Jobs gave at a graduation ceremony on Anderson Cooper where he talks about knowing that he will die, possibly soon, and it makes me want to live every day like him. &nbsp;I have always thought that people with a definite end date are the luckiest in the world. &nbsp;They don't have to worry about the unknown. &nbsp;They know that the only thing that counts is what you do today, because you might not get tomorrow. &nbsp;I only hope that yesterday, Steve was well enough to see the release of the iPhone 4s and that he was satisfied with the future of the company. &nbsp;\nThank you Mr. Jobs for revolutionizing this world and making it a better place for all of us.&nbsp;","header":"","author":"Zach","location":""}
