{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\n\nAs much as I was a strong believer in using Windows everywhere for any \nreason, I have to admit, I have been converted. I own a MacBook and I \nabsolutely love it. I've owned several iPods, and now, I am very glad to \nown an iPhone 4. Personally, I think the iPhone 4 is the most innovative \ntechnology out. The way it feels in your hand, the slimness, all the way \ndown to how rugged it is, yet classy. Your inspiration will be missed, \nand that sincere smile you have when sharing your creation with the \nworld will be remembered. I always looked forward to the Keynote \npresentations you would lead and the new and amazing technology that was \npresented in the show. Thank you for your innovation and your amazing \nmind. No matter what people told you, you always seemed to say to them \n\"It can be done.\"&nbsp;","header":"Remembering Steve Jobbs","author":"Baustin","location":""}
