{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was a great man. At the time of his death, neither him nor  \nus know exactly how his company will affect us in the future. One  \nthing is for sure though, and that is that Apple has changed the way  \nwe listen to music, socialize, and stay connected through the world  \nwhile at home, in the car, or just any where out in this world. He  \nwill be deeply missed, and condolences are sent out to his family and  \nfriends. Rest In Peace, Steve. \n","header":"Steve Jobs - A Life Changer","author":"Dylan","location":""}
