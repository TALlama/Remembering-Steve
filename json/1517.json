{"mainText":"I'm a brazilian 13 year old boy, and I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the entire Apple Team and Steve Jobs  family. I didnt knew Jobs, but he was one of the most important and brilliant mens of the world. He really was the best, in all the ways that a human being could be, as a person and as Apple founder. I will miss him, just like billions of persons. Now Apple will never be the same again, and the world had the Biggest lost of this century.  I dont know how thinks are going to be from now, without the King of the Kings. I dont have anymore words to express how sad I am, the world wont have anybody like him again, He founded the biggest and best empire ever!I dont have words to espress how I love apple products, and Ill always be grateful to Steve Jobs for giving me the opportunity of experiencing the pleasure of having an IPhone and IPod.","header":"Condolences","author":"Lucca","location":"from Brazil"}
