{"mainText":"I grew up with Apple. My dad had a Macintosh color classic that he liked \nto take a part and put back together. When we got our first iMac, my \nbrother and I used to giggle when we wrote ridiculous passages and \nplayed them back in SimpleText. I wrote all my papers in ClarisWorks.\n\nMy parents bought me an iPod when I got into college, and my dad sent \nSteve an e-mail about adding video to the iPod before the launch of the \nvideo enabled iPod.\n\nApple and Steve had a huge impact on my life and my memories. Steve will \nbe missed.","header":"","author":"Jake","location":""}
