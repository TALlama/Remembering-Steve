{"mainText":"I got into the Apple game relatively late. My gateway was an iPod Video \nback in 2006. Since that critical purchase I've owned 4 iPods, 2 \niPhones, 1 MacBook and an iPad. My respect for Apple and Steve Jobs grew \nwith every purchase. Every single product I've ever bought was near \nperfect from the design, the software, even down to the packaging. Even \nthough Steve is gone I believe that what other's have written is true. \nApple is his greatest creation. I look forward to the future and what \nApple has in store for us.\n\nThank you, Steve Jobs. Your work has not only changed my life, but it \nhas changed the world we live in.&nbsp;","header":"RIP Steve Jobs","author":"Dan","location":""}
