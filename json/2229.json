{"mainText":"I was 8 years old when my dad brought home our first computer. It was the\nlate 80's, and it was a Macintosh. Fast forward to today, and I read the sad\nnews on my MacBook. As a physician, I encounter death often. Every life is a\nmiracle in its own way. The miracle of Steve's life is that through his\nvision, he managed to touch the lives of billions of people. That is why his\ndeath feels like a personal loss to me and countless others around the\nworld.\n\nMy heartfelt condolences to his family and friends. He lived an amazing\nlife, not because he created amazing products, but because he loved his\nfamily and followed his passions fearlessly. He is an example to us all.&nbsp;","header":"fearless","author":"Sen","location":""}
