{"mainText":"Since I don't know who is \ngoing to read this e-mail, I would like to simply present my condolences \nto the people who were close to Steve. I may have never met him in my \nlife, but Steve changed my life as he changed the life of many others. \nLast year in public speaking class in college I choose to act his \ninspirational Stanford commencement address and the less I can say is \nthat it was a great feeling to say his words.\n\nI think Steve was a great visionary, and never will another man reach \nhis success and fame in the business world. May he rest in peace.\n\nOnce again, to Steve's closest, may God bless you and your family during \nthis is time,&nbsp;","header":"Condolences","author":"Xavier","location":"from France"}
