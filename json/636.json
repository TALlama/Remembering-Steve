{"mainText":"The Apple finally fell from the tree. Steve Jobs opened, re-opened, and redefined doors of technology. Creating gadgets to make the human life a simpler\n place. To think he was a year younger then my father, brought me to tears. He was a great man and loved what he did. I hope his family feels joy for what he did in his life, not the sad ending. God bless His family and Steve Jobs may his soul finally be at peace. 1955-2011&nbsp;","header":"My condolences","author":"Patricia","location":""}
