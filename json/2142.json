{"mainText":"Steve Jobs is an amazing man. Always coming up with new and revolutionary products, inventing genius ideas and his amazing stage presence made him the best CEO ever. A human being will be hard pressed to aspire to a better founder, creator and mentor other than Steven Paul Jobs. One can only hope that Apple will continue with its legacy as making the best products known to man without this amazing leader. My condolences to his family, I am grieving his loss, but I cannot imagine the grief of his wife and children. Although he is dead and gone, his legacy, life and leadership will continue forever and despite the terrible tragedy, let us rejoice at the wonder of being able to watch Steven Paul Jobs ignite the spark that flamed into a  bonfire of a company we now call Apple Inc.\n\nMy deepest condolences and heartfelt grief.\n","header":"Stevie Wonder","author":"Blake","location":""}
