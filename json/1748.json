{"mainText":"News of the death of Mr. Steve Jobs was such a shock for me that I am not\nable to digest the fact that he is not with us any more.\nHe has been a role model for me and all of us who are Emerging Entrepreneurs\nin Business.\n I am a huge fan of all Apple Products and simply love the brand.\nI think God loves people like Mr. Steve so much that he calls them back to\nHIM very soon.\nThis man came to this earth played his part so well that people though not\nrelated to him are also mourning for him. Guess this is what matters at the\nend for all of us.\nI wish that Mr. Steve rests in peace and attains a wonderful afterlife. My\nsincere condolences to his family - I know its a very difficult period for\nthem and I pray GOD to give them peace during this testing time. &nbsp;","header":"Heavy Heart with saddened voice","author":"Lakshmi","location":""}
