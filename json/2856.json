{"mainText":"Dear Steve Jobs;  \n\nSteve Jobs, if I were to personally meet you, I would say thank you for your amazing work. You truly were an icon. My first laptop was a 2008 MacBook Pro. I remembered when I first opened it, I was in complete AWE! I was amazed of how elegant the design was and how fast and simple it was to use.  At that moment I was not familiar with Macs, I was a PC user. Until I started using Macs I never went back (laughs). So, because of your ingenious and innovative inventions, my job has never been simpler. Steve, God bless you and your family.  R.I.P Steve Jobs. You will never be forgotten for as a part of you is still alive and that part of you is APPLE.&nbsp;","header":"A genius innovator","author":"Ronnie&nbsp;","location":""}
