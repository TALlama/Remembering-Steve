{"mainText":"Dear Apple Family,\n\nI work in Oncology Clinical Trial Research and specifically on a pancreatic clinical trial trying to develop a cancer drug that will help those patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. I truly know how horrible this disease is. I lost my mother to the same disease this April. I work hard everyday to help these patients and hope that one day we can improve patients' lives and cure this disease all together.\n\nI am very sorry that Apple and the world have lost Mr. Jobs as he was a visionary and an excellent business man. My strong condolences to the Apply family! It is such a profound loss. I will take his memory and continue to work towards the development of cancer drugs!!","header":"Condolences for Apple's loss","author":"Jessica","location":""}
