{"mainText":"\nI have touted the genius of Steve Jobs since the 1980's when I first \ntouched an Apple computer. I've called him the \"wunderkind\" of all times \nsince Mozart. I am deeply touched and saddened by this news. Today, I am a Technology Coordinator at an elementary school in North \nHollywood, CA. I run and designed our Mac Computer Lab and teach my \nstudents daily about the wonders of Apple computers. Sometimes the other \nteachers think I'm always doing a commercial for Apple and I do my best, \nand successfully, mind you, to convert the wayward PC users over to \nApple. They are fully aware that I play favorites when it comes to \nTechnology. Stick with the best, Apple.\n\nSteve Jobs is a man I've introduced to my students over the five years \nI've been at the school. I tell them about his genius and how Apple \nstarted with the two Steves. Tomorrow, when I open up my Lab, I will \nhave a small memorial commemorating this wonderful man whom I've loved \nsince 1987.Thank you, Steve, for making this a smarter and more fun world because \nof Apple. Now, it is up to Apple, Inc. to carry on that greatness and \nkeep your spot at the top of innovative Technology.&nbsp;","header":"My Hero","author":"Rebecca","location":"from Hollywood, CA"}
