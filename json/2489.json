But if I had, I would have thanked him for \nchanging the way we all live.&nbsp;\nThanks to Steve Jobs, I was able to sail through college at 32 years old \n&amp; and become a physical therapist assistant...my MacBook at my side the \nentire time.&nbsp;\nAs a dance teacher (my other career) who spent countless wasted dollars \non cds, I now only teach dance class with my IPod classic!\n\nMy sympathy goes out to all the family &amp; friends of this wonderful man.","header":"changed the world","author":"Tara","location":""}
