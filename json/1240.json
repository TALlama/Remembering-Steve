{"mainText":"I am a huge supporter of Apple, I have been all my life as I am 22.  \nSteve Jobs was such a visionary that he was able to usher in a whole  \nnew era of technology and to that, it really means a lot for the  \nworld. He has touched every single one of us in some way shape or  \nform. Even though I never got to meet him, I knew a lot about him and  \nconsidered him my idol, my superman of technology if you will. To the  \nentire Jobs family and friends, my deepest condolences for your loss.  \nTo Apple you lost a father, but you will pull through. Rest in Peace  \nSteve Jobs.","header":"Steve Jobs: The Legacy","author":"Andrew","location":"from Washington"}
