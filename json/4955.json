{"mainText":"Some people say Steve Jobs was the Thomas Edison of our time, but Steve was\nthe Steve Jobs of our times. From a public standpoint, all good things have\nbeen and will be said about him for a long time to come. Even though I’m\njust another fan of his work and the company he created, I now realize how\npersonal my gratitude towards Steve is. He brought pride through innovation\nfor the San Francisco Bay Area, especially Silicon Valley, and in some\nindirect form, he helped me earn a living through his employees  purchasing\nthe consumer durables I sold a few years ago close to the Apple campus.\nLastly, I fondly remember  when I’d go home after work and drove on\nInterstate 280 North, stuck in traffic, and looking at Apple’s main building\ngiant ad poster, which would show pictures of some of the best innovators of\nour time. Well, next time I drive through there, I expect to see Steve’s\npicture there.&nbsp;","header":"Steve was Steve","author":"Fernando","location":"from US Army Fort Bragg, NC"}
