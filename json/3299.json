{"mainText":"Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak brought us a computer \"for the rest of us\" \nand changed the world.  Steve Jobs was a difficult perfectionist, but he \ncreated amazing experiences for the rest us. He inspired us and enriched \nour lives with his creativity.  I bought my first Mac in 1992.  His \n\"insanely great\" products helped me pull my daughter out of autism, \nteaching her the alphabet, and how to properly \"mouth\" the sounds of \nletters at a time when no other computers could do what a Mac could. \nMacs have always been about unleashing our inner creativity.  He has \ninspired a generation of film makers, digital photographers, and \nentrepreneurs.  Not only did he invent the iPhone, the iPod and the \niPad, and the Mac, but he helped bring us Hypertext, which was a \nforerunner of hyperlinking on the Web. He brought us the industry of \ndesktop publishing.  He brought us \"WYSIWYG\" and beautiful fonts, \nrendered on a box that only reads ones and zeros.  He saw great ideas \nand he stole them - just like other great entrepreneurs.  But what truly \nset him apart from the rest was his relentless pursuit of simple beauty, \nthe zen of elegant programming, the perfect curve, and the aesthetic \ntouch that sets Apple products apart.  Godspeed, and thank you, Steve, \nfor making so many of our lives so much better.&nbsp;","header":"Such a sad day","author":"Matt","location":""}
