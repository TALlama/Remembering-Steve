{"mainText":"It seems absolutely absurd to say that a phone changed my life, but it's true. In fact I don't look at my phone as a thing I use to call people it's a tool I use to become who I am. It has molded me and made me smarter, much faster, (lost 25 pounds using an app) I've made so many friends using it! I've found my way and discovered new places, food, games. To think that one man brought to life this period of human intellect. Apples devices have made us all more aware of our planet as a whole our community or connection to each other. They have helped teach us how complicated our \"systems\" have become and\n we now know things must change. We will change them! Thank you Steve for your beautiful life.... Thank you for helping touch so many, for bringing us together and for shooting for perfection! You will be missed you will be loved and never forgotten!&nbsp;","header":"Thanks Steve!","author":"Dan","location":""}
