{"mainText":"Dear Mr.Jobs,\n\nIt is unfortunate that my first ever email to you would come under such \nsad circumstances and it does not feel right that i am typing it on a \nproduct you created but it is your vision and creativity that is \nallowing me to do so. You have left us in person but will always remain \nwith us in spirit. Your soul is imbibed in every iPod, iPad, iMac, \nMacbook, iPhone and Apple TV that Apple has sold and therefore you remain \nwith all of us forever.\n\nI thank you and celebrate along with billions across the world your life \nSteve Jobs! May your soul rest in peace and we will always take with us \neverywhere we go a part of  your soul.\n\nSalut! &nbsp;","header":"Celebrating your life!","author":"Karan","location":""}
