{"mainText":"Even though I never got the chance to personally meet him, and only knew him\n based on what he was like during his infamous keynote sessions, I was always awe struck by the clarity with which he conveyed his visions to the world.\n And it was more importantly his visions for this era of computing that truly fascinated me. The way he made the computer more human has had an astounding effect on the world as we know it today. People no longer are limited by how well their devices fit to their needs, and are able to be more productive, and at the same time more creative. It also brings deep inspiration and inventiveness to an area which only years ago was thought to have been at its peak abilities in that respect. All these fruits of his visions are what in part made me want to become an app developer for iOS. In this way, I am able to say that I got to be a part of this revolution in computing. Even though I'm just a small independent developer, I got to be a part of the humanization\n of technology. And that is something I will never forget. Every time I see an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or even the name or logo of his legacy, Apple, I will find it hard to think back on what it was like before such things were in existence. And I think for all intents and purposes, it can be said that Steve will live on in Apple's philosophies and practices.","header":"What I best Remember...","author":"Spencer","location":""}
