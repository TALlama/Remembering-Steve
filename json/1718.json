{"mainText":"Dear Steve jobs,\n\n\tI only found out about your death 2 minutes ago and I was \nshocked to hear of your death. I think the world has lost a very \nimportant person. You single handedly created the best industry and \ncompany the world has ever known. You are brilliant, you made products \nbefore people knew that they needed them. You were the reason that I \nlove apple today. I am only 14 years old but someday I want to be just \nlike you. I am so sad of your death. No one will ever forget you. Rest \nin Peace.&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Younatan","location":""}
