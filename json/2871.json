{"mainText":"I've never known Mr. Jobs with the exception of his media coverage.  \nI've never owned an Apple product.  The only application of any Apple \nproduct I've used is the \"Apple Quicktime\" player for PC's.\n\nBut besides any of that....I wish to express my deepest condolences to \nMr. Job's Family.  My thoughts and prayers go out to them at this very \nemotional time.  May Steve rest in peace, and may his family take \ncomfort in knowing that he is in God's hands.  Free of any pain.&nbsp;","header":"RIP Mr. Steve Jobs","author":"Gary","location":""}
