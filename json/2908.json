{"mainText":"Since my friend showed me my first Mac in 1991, I have been in love\nwith them.  I have been in awe of what you created. I have been in awe of\nyou. Though I never had the pleasure of meeting you in person I have always\nknown that ever time I turn on my Mac you were there with me. Because I know\nthat a little bit of your soul goes into each and every product you allow to\nbe produced. It's hard to envision Apple without you; I will miss you my\nfriend. To Steve's family my heart aches with your loss. May you find\ncomfort in the the coming weeks.&nbsp;","header":"Goodbye my friend","author":"Zachary&nbsp;","location":""}
