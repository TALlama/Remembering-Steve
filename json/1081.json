{"mainText":"Steve Jobs got me my first Apple computer the the 128K Mac in February 1983.\n Signed inside the box by the original designers, it had the first single floppy Sony drive, an integrated monitor screen, that became the hallmark of the Mac, and greeted you with a smiley face each time you turned it on. 28 years later, I still own that 128k Mac and every Apple product that came thereafter from the Newton to the Cube to the iPhone 4S. God Bless You, Steve Jobs. The world will never be the same.&nbsp;","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Kershner","location":""}
