{"mainText":"Dear Apple Family,\n\nSupporting, discussing, and promoting Apple products have been \nresponsible for my livelihood for all of my professional career. But \nthat's really a small part of why I owe Steve a great debt. We all owe \nSteve not because of what he's done for us in the past few years. We owe \nhim because of what has happened the last 15 years at Apple will change \nour lives forever, or at least the next few hundred years.\n\nI'm grateful to Steve personally and professionally. May God give grace \nand peace to you all during this time of mourning. ","header":"The Debt We Owe","author":"Shayne","location":""}
