{"mainText":"I learned about Steve Jobs and Apple through my girlfriend, who has been a  \ndevoted admirer before I knew her. She loved the products, but most \nimportant,  she greatly admired the passion and vision of Steve Jobs, and she had \nfour books  all about him. She went to every Mac World event, caught things \nwhich were  tossed into the crowd by Jobs. She told me how charismatic he \nwas, that it was  like going to a revival meeting, with all the excitement. She \nloved the story of  how Apple fought and won against the powerful \nMicrosoft. There are very few  public figures she admires, and Steve Jobs was one of \nthem\n \nI don't know very much about technology, but through her I grew to also  \nadmire the greatness of Steve Jobs. And so I am typing this with tears in my  \neyes for someone I had scarcely known about a few years ago. &nbsp;As ill as he \nmust  have been for the last year, Jobs still took time to answer people's \nemails  about his products, even debate with them. He was so devoted and \npassionate  about his great love, Apple, and all it stood for. I wish I could \nhave  followed the whole story for as long as many have. I am glad for those \nthat have  been able to participate as it has all unfolded for the last \ndecades. Steve Jobs  will be in the pantheon of people who changed the world.","header":"Learning about and admiring Steve Jobs","author":"William","location":""}
