And yet, every time I make a phone call, listen \nto a song, type up a report, or watch a video on youtube, a little piece \nof him is there. I always eagerly watched his enthusiastic keynote \npresentations, and anxiously awaited every product arrival. even though \nI never met him, his legacy remains in my life forever. Thank you, Steve \nJobs.\n","header":"","author":"Jake","location":""}
