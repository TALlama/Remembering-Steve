{"mainText":"Dear Apple,\n\nI would like to extend my condolences and sympathy to the Job's family. \nI feel that Mr. Job's  changed the world with his innovative ideas. I \nhave only bought one computer in my  life and it is an Apple. I am \nloving it even though I am still not computer savvy. The world will be a \npoorer place without him.","header":"The World's Loss","author":"Deborah","location":""}
