{"mainText":"My father, who passed away in 1998, was one of the original MacIntosh supporters. He bought one of the first machines and many that followed. I miss my father terribly and one of the things I miss most is how much he would have loved to experience the iPhone, iPad and everything Apple. I often state when new Apple products are launched, \"my Dad would have loved this!\"\n\nI'm saddened by the news of Steve Job's passing. What a tragedy that he was so young. What a great contribution he made to the world.&nbsp;\n\nIn my heart, I hope that Steve meets my Dad in the afterlife and they continue to share in heaven the wonderfulness that Steve brought to our lives here on Earth.&nbsp;","header":"My Dad will welcome Steve","author":"Julie","location":"from Sacramento, CA"}
