{"mainText":"Everyone keeps using the word, but it's so appropriate: VISIONARY.  Steve Jobs was a true visionary and guided a company through the pursuit of perfection with their products, and their customer service.  The quality of Apple's products and service is unparalleled.  Apple is always looking to the future, and to me, Apple represents one of America's greatest ideals: success through innovation, ambition, and hard work.  My dad and I are total Apple geeks, always discussing the latest announcements,  gushing about how much we love our Apple products, and how \"once you go Mac, you never go back.\"  And thanks to the innovation of Steve Jobs and his marvelous company, I was connected to my family and friends while away at college in a way that I never could have been before, and that's made all the difference in my life.  Thank you, Steve, for connecting families, friends, and the world.  \n\n\nWishing all the best for his home family and his Apple family","header":"Thank you for connecting us all, Steve","author":"Nicole","location":""}
