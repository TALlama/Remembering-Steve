{"mainText":"I was not lucky enough to meet Steve Jobs in person but all I know is that this world most definitely would not be the same. Even though what he designed were only \"technology gadgets\" they have put numerous smiles on people's faces. From a one-year old who likes to doodle on the iPad to a college student who can't live without their Apple product to a CEO of a company whom relies extensively on what Steve created. This is a sad day because we have lost one of the greats, a modern day genius. My condolences go out to his wife and family. He's no longer with us but he will never be forgotten. what he created was nothing short of revolutionary and touched many people's lives, just comes to show what one person is able to achieve in a lifetime. Rest in peace Steve. &nbsp;","header":"Remembering Steve Jobs","author":"Hamid","location":""}
