{"mainText":"Dear Sirs,\n\nThis is probably the first time I get in contact with a company to send my condolences for the death of a person I never met.\n\nI just want to say how much I admire Steve Jobs' work. The products Mr. Jobs\n and Apple have developed  over the past years have changed the world. The way we listen to music, how we communicate, what products we use to create art and many other things will keep Mr. Jobs' fingerprint for many years.&nbsp;","header":"Condolences","author":"Guillermo","location":""}
