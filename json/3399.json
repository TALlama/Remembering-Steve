{"mainText":"My husband and I are feeling very sad to know that Steve Jobs, passed away. Please convey our Condolences to all his love ones and to Apple. May he rest in blissful peace. May he be in heaven. He did the world a great deed and service. I know that, without my iPhone3, I would not have been able to manage thru a long illness and serious chronic pain, along with countless health issues. I will always be very grateful for the innovations that he brought forth. The iPhone is my rescue, during the long hours of pain, loneliness, sleepless nights. It's the only thing that helps me keep my mind occupied, day/night in and out. Thank you, Steve Jobs. We will miss you. May the Lord bestow blessing, upon blessings on your soul, forever and ever. We will alway pray for you. We love\n you!!!","header":"Forever grateful! The world will miss him!!!!!!","author":"Ana","location":""}
