{"mainText":"Upon learning of Mr. Steve Jobs death I became sad and emotional.  Our small company recently migrated to all Apple products both behind the walls of our office and in the operating rooms delivering care to our patients.  Without Mr Jobs vision and determination such wonderful life giving instruments would not have been developed.  Steve I admire your passion for making a difference in the lives of this world.  Such a shinning example for all of us to follow.  \"We have but one chance in this world, when opportunity presents itself to help and assist our fellow man, seize the moment, embrace the struggle with passion and never quit while striving to accomplish a difference\".\n\nMay God's light of peace shine down upon the Jobs family and friends.&nbsp;","header":"Sad","author":"Jim","location":""}
