{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was the founder of a company that would do more than he could believe. He was a visionary, a great leader, and an inspiration to his colleagues and family. He was always advancing, doing more and more, but knowing, or maybe not, that he had a sickness that wasn't immune to him or anyone else. The world remembers him today as who he was, but his legacy will not be forgotten. He did this from nothing, and didn't see his company as more important than that; wearing blue jeans and black shirts to presentations the world would see and believe. Whether the biggest Apple fan or just a person at home, everyone felt a little more sad today when we lost this great man.","header":"Steve Jobs 1955-2011","author":"Kyle","location":""}
