{"mainText":"I wanted to send my condolences to you and to Apple in mourning of the loss of such a great person as Steve Jobs. I have always admired your company, and hope to work for Apple in the future. I'm currently 18, and growing up with the innovation of Apple has made me feel like a part of the Apple family, watching all your keynotes from the age of 8 on. &nbsp;Steve will be missed and my heart goes out to all of you who have worked with him and whom he has been close with at Apple. God bless during this difficult time. Know your Apple family is with you!&nbsp;","header":"Fwd: Condolences","author":"Chip","location":""}
