{"mainText":"I was one of the people who appeared in the original batch of Switch ads, back in 2002. It was a different time for Apple than today. But \nalready, back then you could see this was a company in the midst of a \nremarkable rebirth, thanks to the creative genius of Steve Jobs. I was \nhappy to lend a hand when I emailed Apple way-back-when, explaining why \nI took a chance and bought that first iMac when I launched my new \ncompany a year earlier. It wasn't just that Steve was the head of a \ncompany that made great products that helped in my own personal rebirth, \nbuilding my business into what it is today. Steve set an example for so \nmany of us: the best way to give a damn about things that matter to you \ndeeply is to show it with great work that moves and inspires others. \nThank you, Steve. I'll keep giving a damn, putting my own dents in the \nuniverse.&nbsp;","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Patrick","location":""}
