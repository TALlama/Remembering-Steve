{"mainText":"Honestly, I remember seeing the apple logo since I was three. My father and Mother owned an Apple-II in 1992. I never really got into Apple products until 200 when the first iPod was made. That was when I was immersed into the world of Apple and saw Steve's vision for what he wanted to achieve. I am a proud iMac owner and iPod user, and it's all thanks to Steve Jobs. May he be remembered in life always by his family, friends, and co-workers, and may he also be remembered as the man behind each product that touches the consumers.","header":"RIP, Father of the iPod","author":"Zaki","location":""}
