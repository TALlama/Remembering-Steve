His memory will forever live on in Apple's work and in \nmemories of him.\n  I myself have not had the pleasure of meeting him. But he will live on \nin my memories of his company and ideas. He will forever remain an idol \nto me. To start from little and build one of the most powerful companies \nin the world is inspirational, and I hope to have success in my life, as \nhe did his. Again, my greatest condolences to his friends and family.","header":"Steve","author":"Cameron","location":""}
