{"mainText":"Dear friends and family of Steve Jobs:\n\nMy thoughts go out to you during this difficult time. The world has lost\n a creative genius today. I have been a fan of the Apple brand for many years because of Steve's amazing creativity and innovation. My first Apple product was the iPod Mini. I thought it was the greatest invention of the world and nothing else could ever\n top that. Then just a few years later, the iPhone came, which I feel it will become one of the most revolutionary new products of the 21st century. And\n we owe it all to Steve Jobs and the amazing team at Apple.\n\nToday, I feel I've lost a friend. But the world must go on and I look forward to the technology and innovation Apple will bring us in the future.","header":"Thank You Steve","author":"Melissa","location":"from Florida"}
