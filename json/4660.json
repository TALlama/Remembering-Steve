{"mainText":"Rest in Peace Steve Jobs\n\nThank you for bringing such innovation, excellence and excitement to our\nlives and the lives of those who follow on after us.\nOur world would have been so different without you and the Apple team.Just this morning at 12.10am I met my daughter sitting at the top of\nthe stairs, and she was booking in to a seminar using her ipod.\nNo big deal?  This is a university student who seldom spends her money but\nfinally decided to purchase an ipod - just last week and she is now enjoying\nthe excitement of discovering all that an ipod has to offer. Thank you for\nmaking her life so much easier.\n","header":"RIP Steve Jobs","author":"Jane","location":""}
