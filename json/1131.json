{"mainText":"My first computer was a Performa 6500. It was too expensive, not very  \ncapable, but it was a Mac. From the little I knew then about  \ncomputers, I knew that when I finally bought one, it would be a Mac.\nI knew little about computers, but I'd learned a lot about the  \ncreativity and genius of the two people who's founded Apple, and I  \nwanted to be a part of it.\nOver the years, I wore my Apple t-shirt everywhere, and was abused.\nBut when Steve came back and rejuvenated the company, I knew the wait  \nhad been worth it, and that Steve would vindicate all my years of  \nloyalty. He did, in spades.\nAll my years of evangelizing Macs was made worth it by Steve Jobs'  \ngenius.\nNow, it's cool to love Apple and it's products.\nBut some of us always knew and loved Apple and the man who saved it.\nHe can never be replaced or equaled.","header":"I Know I'm Writing This To Myself.","author":"Dale","location":""}
