{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\n\nThank you for touching society with your brilliant visions and  \ninnovation. From Woz's garage to having your inventions tucked in  \nhundreds of millions of pockets, in corners of the world people other  \nthan yourself would never have imagined. You changed how we read  \nbooks, listen to music, and receive information.\n\nYou are one of the all-time greats on the Mt. Rushmore of innovation  \nalong with Edison and Da Vinci. I will watch and listen to your  \nStanford speech on one of your inventions when I am in need of  \ninspiration.\n\nThank you Steve. Rest in peace.","header":"Thank you Steve","author":"Alan","location":"from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"}
