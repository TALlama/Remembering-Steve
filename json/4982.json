{"mainText":"Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. I am one of the millions of people who owe you an enormous debt for literally creating a new world - one where we could work, create, design, make art, learn, listen, talk, live, in an entirely new way. Your work allowed intelligence to become cool again. Your beautiful little machines unlocked ideas, lives, universes. Your vision unleashed a creative army. The world will never be the same. I am forever in your debt. I mourn your passing.&nbsp;","header":"remembering Steve","author":"Elizabeth","location":""}
