{"mainText":"Ever since I was young, my family didn't even know what Apple really \nwas. They just considered it to be a regular computer company. Apple is \nmore than that, and I showed them exactly that. When I was 11 years old, \nI convinced my Mom to buy a MacBook Pro for herself. I spent 2 years \ntrying to convince her. Now I am 14, and my entire family together owns \n5 iPod Touches, 2 iPhones, 1 iPad, and 2 macs. Steve Jobs was such a hero for me, it was because of him that I want to \nbe a computer designer when I grow up.&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs, I'm 14","author":"David","location":""}
