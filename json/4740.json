{"mainText":"I have used Macs since I began using a computer. Apple has been part of \nmy daily life, my entire life. I wouldn't be the person I am with the \nvalues and experiences I have without his incredible passion and vision \nto change the world.\n\nHe's my personal hero and I am so saddened to hear he is no longer with \nus and that I will never be able to spend two minutes with him. My \nthoughts are with his family and will be constantly reminded of his \ninfluence every day for the rest of my life.\n\nThank you. Thank you, Steve. You are missed.","header":"Thank you from Ross Kucsera","author":"Ross","location":""}
