{"mainText":"What a sad day. My deepest condolences to the the family of this visionary,\nSteve Jobs. My deepest condolences to his friends, colleagues, and all those\nhe has affected with his work - which is everyone. Thank you, from the\nbottom of my heart, for making it so easy for me to send a picture of my\nbaby niece and nephew to my family all the way in Eastern Europe in less\nthan a second. Because of you, your vision, your innovation, your genius,\nthe thousands of miles that once separated me from my family no longer\nexist.\n\nYou will be missed, but never forgotten, as you have certainly left many\nwonderful marks in the world. Rest in Peace.\n","header":"","author":"Ivana","location":""}
