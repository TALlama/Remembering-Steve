{"mainText":"I remember as an artist going to college and discovering Macs and how they were going to revolutionize graphic design.  I received my first Mac as a gift but the real power came when the redesign of Macs were introduced.  I bought the first iMac with the swivel top and an iPod as well.  I have not looked back since.  Knowing how much Steve Jobs had a hand in this technology is humbling and inspiring all at the same time.  Thank you Steve for giving the &nbsp;world so much of your mind and it is that much sadder that you are not here to give more.&nbsp;","header":"A true visionary","author":"Nicholas","location":""}
