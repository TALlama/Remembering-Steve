{"mainText":"Even though I'm only a teenager, this news shocked me to the core. Steve \nhas been my idol since my uncle handed me his old original macintosh to \nplay with. Since then my collection of Apple products has grown \nsignificantly. As I live in Australia, I still set my alarm at 3 a.m. \nevery time there is an Apple Keynote on, just so I can see what's \nhappening. Even though you don't know me, I'd like to pass on my condolences to \nSteve's family, and his friends. It was a wish of mine that I would one \nday meet this genius. But now, it'll just remain a dream. R.I.P Steve Jobs!!!!!!! Your innovation and creativity have shaped to unspeakable levels.","header":"Heartbroken","author":"Glenn","location":"from Australia"}
