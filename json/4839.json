{"mainText":"My father introduced our family to Apple in 1980, and it was love at first\nsight for my dad, and for me. To this day, Frogger is my favorite computer\ngame, and I can't imagine my office without a Mac computer (2, actually). It\nalso contains an ipad, an ipod nano, an ipod touch, and an iphone; thanks to\nMr. Jobs, I have been hooked on Apple since 1980. Steve's vision, brilliance\n&amp; hard work changed the world for the good, and it will never be the same\nwithout him. It's hard to imagine the creative world without Steve Jobs in\nit, but the show will go on, and his effect on it will always remain.\n\nR.I.P. Steve Jobs; blessings to your family &amp; the company you leave behind.\nWe will miss you:(.","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Tricia","location":"from Washington, D.C."}
