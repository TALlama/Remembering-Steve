{"mainText":"I remember the first time I worked with a Mac, it was 93 I believe and \nit was an all green screen with huge floppy disks. At the time it was a \nlearning aid for school, thats when I was 6. Now I'm 24 and in college \nand I use a Mac book pro for schooling. I had no idea the impact Steve \nJobs and the Apple Corp would have on my education and future. I don't \nnow if thank you is sufficient enough - but, Thank You. Thank you Steve \nfor vesting your talents into technology that would improve education in \nanother life. Your influence, talents, and generosity will be greatly \nmissed. The world lost a gifted individual today.","header":"Steve","author":"Seth","location":"from Birmingham, AL"}
