{"mainText":"\nSteve, as I sit here writing from my Mac I cannot thank you enough for everything you have changed in my life. I remember the day my parents bought me my first Apple IIe in 1986. Since that day I have loved everything created from Apple. I was there the day you came back in Boston for Macworld. That was the start of when Apple came back. What you and your team created since that day is beyond amazing. I want to offer my deepest symphony to your family for their loss. You changed the world and it will never be the same with out you.","header":"To Steve","author":"Jeff","location":""}
