The\ntechnologies that he has pioneered have not only led to new forms of\nmedia and entertainment -- they've also found use saving lives and\nspreading freedom. His loss is a loss to the world, and we will all\nmiss him dearly. My thoughts also go to the members of his family and\nhis friends, who have seen him taken away far too young. I hope that\nin time they will be able to take strength from his memory and follow\nin his path. ","header":"A sad day","author":"Karthik","location":"from USA"}
