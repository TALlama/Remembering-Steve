{"mainText":"I am very grateful for Steve Jobs. working at the Apple Store at \nWoodfield Mall in Schaumburg, IL I learned my strengths and weakness. \nSteve built a company that gave back in so many ways. Every product is \nan investment in each customers passion. Every employee knows that they \nare enriching lives with a culture that promotes individualism, \ncreativity, and allows everyone to live in a technological world without \nthe need for a degree in engineering. I will never lose what Apple gave \nme; a deeper understanding of myself and the self-confidence to aim \nhigh. Steve will be remembered fondly.&nbsp;","header":"Former Apple employee","author":"Samuel","location":""}
