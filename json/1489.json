{"mainText":"To the Family of Steve Jobs\n\nHis innovation changed my life.\n\nAt a young age I was given and Etch A Sketch and Piano lessons, both tools I used to express my creativity. Years later, I would find there was a tool that connected those two experiences (expressing creative thoughts via sound and vision). My career path changed forever after taking my first graphic design class in college. I switched my major from Architecture to Graphic Arts.&nbsp;\n\nMy first and only platform was Macintosh. The Mac allowed me to be hired at a company where I started as a Jr. Designer and eventually left as VP &amp; GM of Product Development and Creative. That job allowed me to see the world. That job allowed me to live a very good life.&nbsp;\n\nSo I owe my life experience to Mr. Jobs - he made it possible for me to outwardly express what I felt using my hands and my mind.&nbsp;\n\nYou will be missed tremendously but never forgotten!&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;","header":"Thank You","author":"Delanie","location":""}
