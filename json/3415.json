{"mainText":"I remember when I saw my first apple computer at the age of 7. It was a Macbook that had photo booth running on it. I thought that it was the coolest thing that I had ever seen, but now at the age of 13, I've learned how much more apple means than a computer with \"fun little photo programs\"! I've been using various apple products with my photography, video editing, and music making. What Steve has done to this company is just plane awesome! Things without Steve will be different, but I know apple can only get better! I someday\n hope to work for apple, but until that day comes, you have my full support!","header":"","author":"Jack","location":""}
