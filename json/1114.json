{"mainText":"I was shocked and jolted when I heard the terrible news of Steve Jobs being\nno more. A hard worker who followed his passion, a visionary my idol. I am\ndeeply saddened by the loss. He is possibly the only person I look upon from\nthis era. His little talk at Stanford is probably one of the best\nmotivational speeches I have ever heard. I've ever since tried to inculcate\nhis advises from that particular speech. I have no words to express the\nsense of void that I feel in my heart. May his soul rest in peace. Like\nsomeone said, All great people die young. Yes, he was great!!! My deepest\ncondolences to his family for their loss.","header":"A sad day for me","author":"Srihari","location":""}
