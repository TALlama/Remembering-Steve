{"mainText":"Steve,\n\nAlthough I didn't quite realize it at the time, I have been a fan of yours since 1980 when I sat down at my first apple computer in 3rd grade to use the \"Turtle Draw\" program. Today I am an illustrator and compositor, still drawing on my computer, a Mac Pro. You are a personal hero of mine. Your exuberance for life and the design you and your great team at Apple put into your tools and products have enriched my life in so many ways. You will be greatly missed.\n\nThough I never met you I considered you a friend.&nbsp;","header":"We will miss you greatly","author":"George","location":""}
