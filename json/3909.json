{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\n\n   It is hard to express to you the difference you have made in my life.  Rarely \ndo people come along in this world whose philosophies and ideas shape a \ngeneration and indeed a planet at the level you have.  What is important is that \nyou did that one person at a time, one child at a time, one life at a time.  My \nlife was one of those.  For as long as I can I remember I have carried your \nideas around with me.  They began with a big bulky box in a heavy bag and \ncontinue with the smallest of devices that I carry around in my pocket.  Devices \nthat I live with throughout my day.  These ideas have allowed me to unleash \nuntold creative ideas and products, teach young minds about their world, and \nhelp friends find their way.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your \nvision.  It truly has made a difference in my life.\n\nAll this from a person you never met.\n\nGod Bless you and keep you Steve Jobs - you will be missed.\n\nAn apple customer for the past 26 years.","header":"Steve Jobs passing","author":"Tom","location":""}
