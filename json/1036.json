{"mainText":"\nI began my art education as a graphic design major -  We had the coolest looking mac computers, the big blue ones, which no one outside of the Art world would dare use!  I was an outcast using a Mac, a real odd ball.  PC users were on the rise, and only the really far out art people used APPLE.\nBut the art world loved their APPLE computers, and despite all the ridicule, being on the verge of bankruptcy , and the inability to communicate at times with anyone outside of the APPLE world, we stuck it out!  And look at us now.  We are now and always will be the true Apple nuts!  Thanks Steve, for all the forward thinking, the passion and your artistic vision. You are Apple.  And we thank you for that!&nbsp;","header":"Graphic Design","author":"Rosalie","location":""}
