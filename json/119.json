{"mainText":"10.5.11\nDear Inspiration,\n\nSteve Jobs was the person of the world. It is hard to believe he died today. But he will live in our hearts forever. To me he was the best. One thing I always wanted to do was to meet him, but I never got the chance. Even though I was never able to meet him, I already feel like I know him through his awesome products. He really changed the way this world worked. I am just baffled. He is a legend that will live on forever.\nR.I.P Steve Jobs.\nFeb. 24 1955 - Oct. 5 2011&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs R.I.P","author":"Houston","location":""}
