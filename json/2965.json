{"mainText":"To whoever it may concern,\nApple has changed my view of computers and technology forever, in a way nobody but Steve Jobs could have. I cried reading about his passing, but at least he is out of his pain and suffering. He's left an impact on this world in a way that's completely unforgettable. My most heartfelt condolences and sorrow goes out to his family, loved ones, friends, colleagues, and anyone whose life he has touched, or who has had the wondrous pleasure to have met him. I know he will be remembered and his legacy will live on throughout Apple and the technology world. \nSincerely, A proud Apple supporter and customer.\n","header":"","author":"Regina","location":""}
