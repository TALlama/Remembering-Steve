{"mainText":"I would like to offer all the employees at Apple my sincerest condolences.&nbsp;\n\nSteve made me excited to be an Apple user.  I always have been and always will be loyal to the idea of making things simple.&nbsp;\n\nSteve has inspired me to get to where I am today in the wireless industry. \n Apple products make it possible for me to have my job today.  Without them\n my job would still only be an idea.&nbsp;\n\nThank you for the gift of dreams Steve.","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Peter","location":""}
