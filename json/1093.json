{"mainText":"It is with great sadness that I read about the passing of Steve Jobs. I have been a long time aficionado of all things Apple. Being someone who is a self-professed techie, I had such great admiration for his vision and creativity. I know Apple, the company, will survive and prosper, because I know he would have it no other way. He had such a personality and through his excitement for a new technology, he got the rest of us excited. His enthusiasm was contagious! The world is indeed a very different and better place because of Steve Jobs.","header":"Condolences","author":"Barbara","location":""}
