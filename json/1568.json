{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\n\nYou left us way too young. You made America proud. Your life story is an inspiration. You showed the benefits of bringing creativity to all aspects of life. Not only were you brilliant, you were as fun to look at as your products. You simply were well-designed. \n\nI'm sure you're hanging out now watching angels on iPhones and God/Goddess/the Great Spirit tapping away on iPads.\n\nNow, get some rest up there.\n\nCondolences to all affected.","header":"Thanks, Steve","author":"Vicky","location":""}
