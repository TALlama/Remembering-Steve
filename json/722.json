{"mainText":"I have been looking up to you and your creations since I was 5 years old. I am 24 today. My whole life has been built and shaped by machines that have come together from your visions. My professional life is only possible because of hardware and software that was once just a thought in your head and a vision for a better tomorrow. My personal life is more fun and enjoyable because of your want and need for a personal computer to be exactly that: personal. \n\nI want to keep this short, as I cannot continue to write through the tears. There is no way to describe what impact you have had on my life, as someone that you've never met and will never know, but I thank you for everything that you have done.\n\nRest in Peace, Steve.\n\nThank you.","header":"Thank You Steve","author":"Casey","location":""}
