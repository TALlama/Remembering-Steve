{"mainText":"I believe that Steve Jobs has inspired the world of technology. If it weren't for his great mind I wouldn't be sending this email from an iPad, or even a\n tablet. There wouldn't be the smart phone as we know it today. We would all\n be using phones with slide out keyboards. I am new as an apple fan (about 2\n years now) and this is very saddening to me. I know Steve jobs would love to see apple do better that it did even when he was CEO and I'm sure this amazing company he built will do wonderful in its future days. R.I.P.
