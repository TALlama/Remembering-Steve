{"mainText":"I recently watched a documentary about Steve Job's life and the genesis \nof Apple Computers.  I became an Apple user in 1999 and have been one \never since.  I am grateful to Steve Jobs and the other hard workers at \nApple for making things that work.  I  also recently read something \nSteve said about living for your passion and it resonated deeply in me.\n\nRare people like Steve Jobs are certainly missed but more than that, you \nwonder how things would be without their inspiration and innovation.","header":"Good Bye Steve Jobs","author":"Greg","location":""}
