{"mainText":"Although I never personally met Steve Jobs, I am sitting here tonight with tears since hearing the news.  I have been a dedicated Apple user for 15+ years and as a graphic and web designer, I cannot be more thankful and appreciative to what Steve, his team and everyone from Apple has done to make my job not only easier, but allow me to be faster and more creative.  From using Apple products to just simply visiting the Apple store, the geniuses makes the Apple experience innovative and a one of a kind experience.  A 'family' experience.  My condolences to his family, friends and co-workers.\n\nSteve, you will be greatly missed and always remembered by millions.  Thank you and please be in peace.&nbsp;","header":"I am saddened","author":"Rich","location":""}
