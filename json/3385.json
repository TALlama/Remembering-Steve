{"mainText":"Steve Jobs is a man whom I never met, but who has shaped my life in so many\nways. Outside of the amazing innovation that helped to introduce going all\nthe way back to the mouse in the 1980's and the iPod in the early 2000's, he\ninnovated the way people did business, how they marketed, how they were\nentertained. His ideas and innovations created a world in which I found joy\nin technology and became connected to people whom I never could have\nimagined meeting.\n\nThere's a lot of things I want to say and it's hard to say it without\nstumbling over myself. I can boil it down to one statement: I don't have\nmany heroes or people whom I look up to. I can count them on one hand, and\nSteve Jobs was one of them. Without him and the other amazing innovators at\nApple I wouldn't have found the joy of technology and had a career in it.\n\nThanks, Steve, and thanks, Apple.","header":"A tremendous loss to innovation","author":"Scott","location":""}
