{"mainText":"I just want to start off by saying your creations have changed the world \ntoday. You are the reason why so many companies evolved technologically. \nI was the biggest fan of apple since the iPod. But after you came out \nwith the new apple computers, i've fell in love with your products even \nmore. I've seen every speech of yours and realized that you don't do this \nfor the money. You do this for the love of creating something newer and \nbetter. Your energy, enthusiasm, and love for your fans will always be \nremembered. Rest in peace.\n","header":"You will never be forgotten.","author":"Rafael","location":""}
