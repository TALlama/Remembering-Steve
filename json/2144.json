{"mainText":"Hey Steve,\n\n\tCan I call you Steve? We have never met, so maybe it's Mr. Jobs? But  \nyou have been a large part of my life for many years now so if you  \ndon't mind too much, I will just call you Steve. This may be entirely  \npointless  but I just want to thank you. I want to thank you for  \nopening doors into new worlds and brighter futures. You have changed  \nthe lives of millions, including mine. From the techy dad who talked  \nof you to the colored mac desktops that I had in elementary school...  \nI remember thinking those were the most amazing things ever by the  \nway. And Bugdom became my complete obsession for my entire 3rd grade  \ncareer....But to be honest you really came into my life with your  \ninnovation of the ipod. Pure genius. And you cemented yourself in my  \nlife with Macbook. And please note, I am not talking about the objects  \nthemselves so much as what they have meant to me, what they have done  \nfor me, and where they have taken me. You will never know just how  \nmuch you have done for me or how much you have changed the lives of  \nmillions, it's probably incomprehensible. But I just want to say thank  \nyou once again, from the bottom of my heart. Im grateful for your  \nlife, your sacrifices, your innovation, and your life.&nbsp;","header":"Thanks Steve!","author":"Colleen","location":""}
