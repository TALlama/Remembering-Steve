{"mainText":"\tThank you for changing the world. You leave behind so many fans, \nwell wishers and now grievers. I can't begin to say how wonderful of a \nperson you were in my eyes. A warm smile and a kind heart shines in \nlasting memory and hope that your family can hold up ok without your \npresence. I love the feeling, that I knew you through the product you \nmade. You will never be forgotten. You are Apple. I am Apple. Thanks for \nevery seed you planted, for the roots that spread through the world and \nfor the fruits of your beautiful mind and efforts. Thank you for Apple.","header":"Steve.","author":"Kyle","location":"from Austin"}
