{"mainText":"Wow! I am deeply saddened, at this time, to hear of the passing of Mr. \nSteve Jobs. I am a very big supporter and consumer of all things Apple \nand was disappointed when I learned of his resignation. I can only hope \nand pray for the strength of those who are affected by the loss. I will \nfeel the void anytime Apple is mentioned or whenever I utilize my many \nApple devices. He was certainly an innovative, genius, and seemingly \nkind soul. He will surely be missed by myself and others.","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Ja'Net","location":""}
