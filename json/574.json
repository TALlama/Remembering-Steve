{"mainText":"As I sit here typing on my Mac laptop, it's surreal that the man who \nmade all this possible has died. I cried two years ago when I opened the \niPhone that my sons gave me for Christmas. Some would think I was crazy, \nbut that, I discovered was the kid in me. I had more fun with that phone \nover the Christmas holiday...learning, exploring, creating. Steve \nJobs and Apple have created a whole new world for billions.\n\nWe have all been touched by an amazing man. My prayers are with his \nfamily and friends.&nbsp;","header":"You will be missed..","author":"Kathy","location":""}
