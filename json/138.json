{"mainText":"To Steve Job's Family and Team\n\nI have followed Steve's story closely since 1986. I have read many of the articles, books (I have some on my bookshelf and two on my iPad), websites and anything else I could get my hands on.  His life has been an amazing and inspiring journey.\n\nIt is his passion, his thinking and commitment to the experience of the user that I admire the most.\n\nMay you all find peace and may Steve's legacy live on. &nbsp;","header":"thank you Steve","author":"Edward","location":""}
