{"mainText":"I am where I am today because of Steve, I as a first grader back in 1981 got to use an Apple IIe for the very first time.  From that \npoint on I was in love with computers.  Today some 30 years later I am work\ningin the computer industry as a help desk technician.  I took a while to \nturn a hobby into my career but I have always credited my love of computers\n to that first Apple IIe.  I have never met Steve but I feel like I would not be who I am today without his contributions to the world.\n\nGod speed Steve and my prayers are to you and your family.&nbsp;","header":"God speed and my condolances to your family Steve&nbsp;","author":"Mike","location":""}
