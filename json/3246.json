{"mainText":"Dearest Steve,\n\nRest in Peace for you have not only changed our lives but also changed the World and the future!\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was fascinated by computers but it was a Mac which made me fall in love with computers! Now even as a Medical Professional, my love for Apple makes me better at what I do and made it possible to follow my destiny.\n\nAs a self financed student it is hard to manage tuition and I have to work part-time. My expertise on Macs that I developed as a hobby ended up useful enough for me to get a part-time job at Apple. Now Apple also has helped me with my Med school.\n\nSteve, I'm ever thankful to you for making such great products and simply showing and taking us to the future!\n\nWe all owe you a lot.&nbsp;","header":"Steve, we all owe you!","author":"Hassan","location":""}
