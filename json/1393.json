{"mainText":"First of all, my sincerest condolences to the Jobs family as well as the \nentire Apple family.  Being on stage, knowing what we didn't know, \ncouldn't have been easy.\n\nWhile I never met Steve Jobs, I'm incredibly saddened by his passing \nbecause I know that his vision has revolutionized how I use and \nconceptualize technology.  Aesthetically-stunning designs, intuitive \nuser interfaces, a committment to quality.\n\nSo here's to the crazy one. The misfit. The rebel. The troublemaker. The \nround peg in the square hole. The one who saw things differently.  He \nwasn't fond of rules, and he had no respect for the status quo.  We can \nquote him, disagree with him, glorify or vilify him.  About the only \nthing we can't do is ignore him because he changed things. He pushed the \nhuman race forward. And while some may see him as the crazy one, we saw \ngenius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change \nthe world are the ones who do.\n\nAnd he did.\n\nGoodbye Steve.\n","header":"Goodbye Steve","author":"Justin","location":""}
