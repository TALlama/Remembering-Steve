{"mainText":"Dear Apple Team,\nMy family and I were saddened to hear about the passing of Mr. Jobs.  I am a\n 68 year old person who loves computers and techie stuff, but was not very good at using them.    So it was such a gift to be able to own an iPod, an iPad, and an iPhone, and BE ABLE TO USE ALL OF THE FEATURES ON EACH OF THEM!  My passion is listening to music.  So the iPod was like a miracle to me.\n  To be able to download my cd collection to my computer, and then put playlists on my iPod, and be able to listen to any kind of music, anywhere...I can't even begin to thank all of you who made this possible. My second passion is reading.  So now with my iPad, I can download any book\n and literally have a library with me wherever I am.  Another technological miracle.&nbsp;The iPhone is the first phone I have ever owned that is user friendly, and trust me, I had tried many.I just wanted you to know who much my life was improved because of Mr. Jobs and his amazing ideas.  Please add my condolences to the millions you must be\n receiving, for his family and of couse the Apple Team.","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Kathleen","location":""}
