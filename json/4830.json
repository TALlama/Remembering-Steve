{"mainText":"I have lighted candle tonight by my iPhone, MacbookPro and iMac. As a graphic designer and web developer, Steve Jobs changed my life. I couldn't do what I do and I couldn't pursue my journey without his genius vision. He gave me all the tools I need to fulfill my mission. Can't thank him enough what he has done for the world. Thank You, Steve!!&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs..","author":"Iva","location":""}
