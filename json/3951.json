{"mainText":"Hi.  Just wanted to share my heartfelt condolences with  the family and \nfriends of Steve.  Not only was Steve a visionary and a  genius, but also a \npowerful entity.  Though I never had the pleasure  of meeting him, he seemed \nlike a special person; a down-to-earth and kind  man, with an incredible \nintellect.  Some of the thoughts and wisdom  that shined during his commencement \nspeeches, were very powerful and  truly inspirational.  The world lost a \ngood soul, before his  time.  My thoughts go out to everyone that is touched by \nhis  unfortunate passing.&nbsp;","header":"Rest In Peace, Steve.","author":"Bobby","location":""}
