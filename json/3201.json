{"mainText":"Dear Apple,\n\n\tI am a visually impaired student who has found a liking to Apple products after I have discovered the wonders of VoiceOver. I am typing this message on my Apple iPad with VoiceOver and would like to thank Steve Jobs, for whom I wouldn't have this easy computer experience.\n\tThe past year I have done many presentations to school division boards and services of how blind and visually impaired individuals can benefit from using the Apple iPad. Shortly after these presentations, I have tutored many people of how to use their newly purchased iPad with VoiceOver and Zoom, and have actually got the Manitoba Education Department purchasing and distributing iPads to blind and visually impaired students within the province.\n\tI do not know Steve Jobs personally, but feel close to him as his products won me over with the most advanced accessibility features out there.","header":"Thank you","author":"Michael","location":"from Canada"}
