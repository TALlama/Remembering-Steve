{"mainText":"I never met Steve Jobs, although I did work for Apple for a few years and was on campus when he was. There is no way to measure the immense impact Steve Jobs had on this company and the widespread influences he had not only in personal computers, but music, film, the way we listen to and purchase media and most recently the entire phone industry.\n\nOnly Steve Jobs could have taken a company near bankruptcy in 1997 and made it the most valuable company in the world. Nobody can ever replace this genius, but alas, he has a company whose veins runs with his DNA. Apple will continue to lead the world in innovation and genius, just like its founder. We will miss you Steve, one of the greatest visionary geniuses of our time.&nbsp;","header":"Steve in my world","author":"James","location":""}
