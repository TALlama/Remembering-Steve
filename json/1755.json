{"mainText":"From my first Apple 2+ that was with me through grade school\nto my Mac Classic that I wrote my reports on in high school\nto my Power Mac 7500 in college. It was Steve's products that produced a college graduate with a degree in electrical engineering. My sincerest condolences and my greatest appreciation and thanks for helping me get to where I am today. You are missed and remembered.","header":"Apple and Mac got me where I am today","author":"Matt","location":""}
