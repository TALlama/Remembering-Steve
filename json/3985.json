{"mainText":"Hi,\n\nI would like to express my condolences to the family, friends, and\ncolleagues of Steve Jobs.\n\nI know that, in America, Steve Jobs played a big role in many ways. I didn't\nhave the same opportunity to at least hear all the great work he's been\ndoing right from the start until Youtube was born. At a younger age, I\nremember catching only few second glimpses of him and Apple's progress as he\npresented himself and his company to media. Needless to say, when I had the\nopportunity with the help of the Internet, I became a huge fan of Steve Jobs\nas I discover how he really changed the world. How I wish he is still with\nus for a much longer time. I share in your sorrow on this sad moment.","header":"Condolence","author":"Paolo","location":"from Manila, Philippines"}
