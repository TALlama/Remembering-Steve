{"mainText":"I have worked on Steve Jobs' keynote address broadcasts for over 10 years.  Although I never actually talked to him, I felt like he was a friend, a mentor and a true visionary.  I was always impressed with his genuine enthusiasm for his products.  I've been hooked on Apple for many years and I owe it all to him!  I feel like I lost a family member today and I can't help but cry.  I know he was sick for many years, but I just wasn't ready for the day to come.  He was a genius and he will be missed.","header":"The world feels a little emptier today","author":"Terre","location":""}
