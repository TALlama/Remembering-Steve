Your determination and pure belief in what was \nright over what was perceived to be right has influenced a generation.\n\nYour Keynote speeches were concentrated passion and always held the \nattention of the world as they watched.  Genuinely, watching your \npresentation for permission to build the new Apple HQ, I couldn't help \nbut feel that you were giving every last thing you had to secure the \nimportant efforts of what you had created.\n\nYou are at peace now but will always be remembered for everything you \nare and were.\n\nI will miss you.","header":"An influence on lives","author":"Melvyn","location":""}
