{"mainText":"Thank you for founding such an amazing company!\n\nThank you for creating such innovative products that were not only \npractical but beautiful and sexy and we all wanted to be seen carrying \nthem. &nbsp;I remember when I got my first Mac, my first iPod, my first iPhone, my \nfirst iPad. I had such excitement, such anticipation to get my hands on \nthem. You changed the way we looked at those products. They were not \njust a computer, just a phone, or just a music player. They were part of \nus, part of our identity and you were in all of them. A piece of you \nstayed with those products. They were your ideas, your dreams come true. \nYour passion was what made those products amazing. Your dedication to \nthe company is what made it so successful. &nbsp;Your legacy will live on and Apple will be remembered as the greatest \ncompany that was made successful by the greatest person and CEO an \namerican company has ever seen.\n\nNothing of course will ever be the same. I'm just glad that I was part \nof it while you were still there overseeing every detail. You made me a \nApple fan. An Apple fan I will forever remain. &nbsp;I'm so sorry to see you go. You were not done. I'm sure you had many \ngreat ideas to come. I wish you would've stayed longer. To your family I give my deepest condolences, for you were more than \njust an icon to them. May your soul rest in peace. You will be forever \nremember by all of us who love Apple.","header":"Goodbye Steve...","author":"Yennyfer","location":""}
