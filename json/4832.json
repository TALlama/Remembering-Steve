{"mainText":"Dear Mr. Jobs,\n\nMaya Angelou once said, \"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\" I'd like to establish the fact that I am thankful, blessed, and grateful to be able to have the gift that you have worked so hard to create for us. It's been absolutely my pleasure to be able to live during the Golden Era of the Apple franchise. May you rest in peace.&nbsp;","header":"Thank you Steve","author":"Vincent","location":""}
