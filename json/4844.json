{"mainText":"Dear Steve, \n\nYou were an inspiration to an entire generation of kids and entrepreneurs. I'm having trouble putting the sadness I'm feeling upon your loss, to words. May the world produce more sons like you to fill the void that's now left by your absence. The 'dent' that you've left on the universe will be forever felt by the future generations. May we continue in your footsteps and innovate, and make the world a better place.\n\nRest in peace.","header":"Rest In Peace Steve","author":"Haider","location":"from Houston, TX"}
