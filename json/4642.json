{"mainText":"The day Steve died was my last day at apple retail. A coincidence mind you but it made it that much more real and impactful . I never met the man. I admired his innovation, imagination, belief in himself and others and most of all his passion. He loved what he did and strived to be the best at it. He will be sorely missed and remembered as a great man who is proof that if you believe in something and are willing to work hard for it you can go from a garage to the most admired company in the world. My heart goes out to his family and friends. I am sorry for your loss and wish you well.&nbsp;","header":"A great man I never met","author":"Andy","location":""}
