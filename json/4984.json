Really saddened by it and\nits really hard to believe. May Steve rest in peace. Looks like he was\nsuffering from the said disease badly. Gods will is Gods will. He made a\nempire in a matter of few years and made people to believe in what he made,\nfull of fun, creativity. Hats off to him. I am and was a great fan of him\nand his products since childhood and always follow what he has done and what\nhe wants to do next.\n\nOnce again thanks a ton Steve and god bless you.","header":"Amazing Steve","author":"Sumeet","location":""}
