{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\n\nYou are no longer with us but your time here on Earth was incredibly memorable. &nbsp;I just wanted to thank you personally for not only the great products you have provided but showing the incredible spirit that you possessed. &nbsp;I would have loved to have met you but never got the opportunity. &nbsp;I am a college student and I try to model myself after that great spirit that you displayed. &nbsp;It has showed me to shoot for the stars and never settle. &nbsp;I plan to attain my PhD eventually and will remember your words forever. &nbsp;My condolences to your family. May God be with you.&nbsp;","header":"You will be missed.......","author":"Jacob","location":""}
