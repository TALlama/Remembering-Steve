{"mainText":"I don't think anyone has affected my digital life so directly as Steve\nJobs has. His vision was unparalleled, something we witness maybe once\nin a 100 years. Quite frankly, Steve changed the world. He showed me\nit was ok to dream big, to think differently. His commencement speech\nat Stanford a few years ago should be a must read for every single\nperson...it has some of the most valuable lessons you can learn about\nlife. Apple products are a thing of beauty with a\npersonality....something that is not matched by any other material\nitem. His soul is in every one of them.\nAs I type this email on my Mac, after receiving the sad news on my\niPhone.... there is no denying that his affect will remain with me for\nthe rest of my life.\n\nWe will miss you Steve. A world has lost a great human being.\n","header":"A true visionary","author":"Amit","location":""}
