{"mainText":"\nAs a fan of Apple since the very beginning, someone who talks and promotes Apple products to friends and family members and virtually anyone who listens, as someone who listens to every keynote and then watches it again, I have come to admire the man in a way that is most uncommon. That someone could run such a huge company, and run it so well, and not only take Apple to new ideas and places through it's products, but the world and the culture along for the\n ride, leaves me awestruck when I stop to think of it. In his own simple and exceptional way, he was a great man. And I will miss seeing him.","header":"Timely","author":"Jeff","location":""}
