{"mainText":"Dear Apple, I remember in 1986 at 13 years old getting an Apple IIC and how utterly amazing it was. Now at 38 years old I can't fathom life without the innovations that Steve and Apple have provided for us as well as Pixar, the mouse and other design and media. Thank you Steve...I write this with tears in my eyes but joy in my heart. We will all miss you terribly but you will live on in all\n of our hearts.&nbsp;","header":"Remembrance","author":"Keith","location":""}
