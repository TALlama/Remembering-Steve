{"mainText":"To Steve's family, friends, and colleagues,\n\n\nIt deeply saddens me to hear of Steve's passing. He was an inspiration for me and all of us in the tech industry. His was a bright example of what can be done by those who do not accept the status quo. \n\nI know there is nothing that can be done to bring him back, but please let me know if there is any way I can help to make his passing any more bearable. Steve will forever be fondly remembered by me!","header":"Steve will be missed","author":"Bart","location":"from Austin, TX"}
