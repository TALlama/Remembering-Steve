This man that I\nhad never met or even slightly knew had changed part of my life. With\nhis vision my profession exists. Graphic Design will forever be\nindebted to this great innovator. Thank you Steve, I am able to be a\nfreelance artist and a stay at home mom because of your work. My\nprayers go out to your family in this time of great loss.&nbsp;","header":"Steve","author":"Emilie","location":""}
