{"mainText":"Once upon a time, I would have never counted a CEO among people I admired. Steve Jobs changed that. Though I never met him personally, his presence at events seemed warm. His personality, welcoming and genuine. Apple, under his helm, produced products that literally changed my path in life. I wouldn't be where I am today had it not been for my first Apple product: a PowerBook G4.\n\nI've often thought about how I would love to sit down and have dinner with Steve. Not to gawk over his celebrity, but to simply chat as two human beings. Although that possibility was slim, now it is zero.\n\nToday I shed tears for the loss of a person I have never met. I can't say that has ever happened before. I offer my most sincere condolences to the Jobs family. &nbsp;","header":"A heartfelt message","author":"Brian","location":""}
