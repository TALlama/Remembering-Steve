{"mainText":"I'm honored to be a part of the generation that saw Steve Jobs and Apple \nliterally change our world!  I stand in awe of the technological \nrevolution that he was a part of, and that still continues through Apple \nand other companies inspired by the work of Apple.\nI can't imagine life without Apple products, it has become so ingrained \nin our culture; and not just ours (Americans), but the culture of the \nworld.\nWhat a visionary.  What a genius. &nbsp;Thank you to Steve Jobs, for making the world a better place!\n\n\n\n\n\n","header":"","author":"Dianna","location":""}
