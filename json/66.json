{"mainText":"Today we lost a great person. Of course he was a top innovator of our \ntime, but he was also a person. Everything he did he did not do for \nhimself but for his family and company. You never hear him in an \ninterview talking about himself, but about Apple.\n\nHe gave us things that today we cannot live without. As I'm writing this \nI noticed that I am writing this to you on a MacBook Pro with the mail \napp. I used the original iPod in 2001, I am an iPhone user and have been \nfor sometime, I have always wanted an iPad 2 but cant afford it yet, \n(but will get it someday) haha. Apple has been a huge part of my life I \nwouldnt be able to get through school without my MacBook Pro. So I would \njust like to thank Steve and Apple for everything you've done for me \npersonally, the world would be a very different place if Apple didnt \nexist.\n\nLong live Steve.\n","header":"No one but Steve","author":"Rex","location":"from <br>"}
