{"mainText":"To The Family of Steve Jobs;\n\nI wish to send my deepest and most sincere condolences to the family of\nSteve Jobs and Apple employees.  I bought my first Macintosh in 1984\ninspired by the ease-of-use of Apple technology.  That initial purchase\nhooked me into a 27 year romance of Apple innovation, technology, and\nproducts.  Today, gray haired and aging, every time I turn-on any Apple\nproduct I admire Steve's ability to make superior products for humankind\nthat work with minimal effort and bring great joy to use.  For me, Steve\nJobs has been a visionary that enabled productivity and creativity of the\nfirst order to the end-user. I will\nmiss his commanding presence that drove Apple to become the world premier\ncompany that it is today. Steve's spirit will live on through the products he helped\ncreate.","header":"Sincere Condolences","author":"Ken","location":""}
