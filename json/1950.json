{"mainText":"It took a great man to create the company you created and to see a nation\nlose an innovator as yourself is deeply disturbing. Although there is some\nout there who has watched your rise and is sitting at home thinking of new\nways to change the world as you did, today is a day we could compare to the\nlost of the many icons we have had to say good-bye to. The world mourns as\nwe all sit back thinking how strong you must have been. A friend of mines\nspoke on how you planted a seed in the world of technology and how fitting\nwas it for you to call your company Apple. It's the little things that make\nimpacts on the greatest people. You were great, you will be missed, you will\nforever be remembered as one of the greatest innovators of our time. God\nbless you and your family.","header":"Heartfelt Condolences","author":"Henry","location":""}
