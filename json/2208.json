{"mainText":"I remember when I bought my first Apple.  It was a 2GS.  My friends \nlaughed at me until they tried it.  They stopped laughing.  It has been \na joy from that day forward through many Apple products, powerbooks, \ndesktops and always it seemed, I was in the minority among my peers, yet \nsecretly just laughing at them as they remained staunch in there defense \nof PC and Microsoft.  Eventually, one by one they all migrated over to \nan Apple product as they finally realized what I had known all along.  \nThat to work on an Apple product, to use one, was just easy and fun.  No \nquestion.  Steve Jobs changed the way I utilized technology and I will \nalways, always be forever thankful for his brilliance and daring.\n\nIt was fitting that I heard of his passing on my iPhone in a text.\n\nMy heart goes out to his family.","header":"I feel like I lost a family member","author":"Glenn","location":""}
