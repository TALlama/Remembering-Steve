{"mainText":"Steve Jobs changed my world for the better. I didn't know Steve Jobs. I \nnever met Steve Jobs. But the thought of him, his quest for excellence, \nhis passion for life and everything that intrigued him, inspires me \nevery day to be better than I am. It seemed to me that Steve was all about character and living a good \nlife. Steve was a consummate teacher. In the end, this intensely private \nperson taught us how to live and taught us how to die.\nMy heart goes out to his wife and his children. Although it is so very \nsad to lose a husband and father at such a young age, what a blessing \nfor his children to have experienced him and to have been influenced by \nhim, especially these wonderfully creative and productive last few \nyears.\nRest in peace.","header":"Condolences","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
