{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\n\nI honestly was not very familiar with Apple and Apple products until the past few years, and I didn't realize you were the man behind the apple until \na couple years ago. I've always admired your products, and never dreamed I \nwould own any until I was a lot older and working in the real world (I am currently in my senior year of college). However, through hard work I have done now, I acquired a Macbook this past year, and was surprised with an Iphone by my parents for being on the Dean's list. Those who know me eventually got annoyed with me constantly saying, \" I can't believe I have a Mac, I \ncan't believe I have an Iphone.\" Your life's achievements are incredible. You were blessed with a gift, and \nyou shared it with the world. Not many can attest to that. As I mentioned, \nI do not know you aside from what I have read. I know you through the Macbook I am currently typing on, and the Iphone that is next to me. Regardless \nof how I know you, your passing strikes a chord with me. It is so hard to see someone with so much to give be taken so soon. Even as I type this I am \nat a loss of what to say. A part of me doesn't even know why I feel this need to say anything at all. I'll end with condolences to your family and friends. And a thank you, for \nbeing who you were, and doing everything you did while you were here.&nbsp;","header":"","author":"Lauren","location":""}
