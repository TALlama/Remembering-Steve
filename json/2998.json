{"mainText":"I recieved my first iPod when I was 13 years old. It was an iPod mini, and I still have it in my bedroom. I was amazed by it's beauty, it's simplicity and by the click wheel! That was the thing that got me wondering \"who could think of such an easy way to scroll through menus?\".\n\nA years later I received an iMac for Christmas. Everyone from my family was curious to see how it worked, and through the past 4 years I have been using and learning how to take advantage of each and single feature of it. I have since then watched every Apple keynote, starting from the introduction of the first Macintosh to the unveal of the iPhone 4s.\n\nI started college just a week ago and I had chosen already to follow Computer Sciences, as my dream was to actually work for Steve, or at least get to see him in the hall. I mourn the fact that it won't be possible, but I have true beliefs that the Apple team will continue his proud work.\n\nWe have indeed lost a genious, but I chose today not to lose my dream and to work and study so that maybe, one day, I get to step inside the Apple campus.\n\nI pray that he rests in peace, and I truly believe he has acomplished most of his life's goals.\n\nThis is a fan's point of view, from across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n","header":"A fan's point of view.","author":"Luis","location":""}
