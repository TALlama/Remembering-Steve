This is a very sad for me\npersonally, knowing that Steve is no longer with us.  I always look forward\nto his presentations when a new product was introduced, and looked forward\nto what was coming next.\n\n He will be truly missed by people he never knew. Thanks Steve for Apple,\nand all that it stands for.&nbsp;","header":"A very sad day indeed","author":"Tony","location":"from Longview, TX"}
