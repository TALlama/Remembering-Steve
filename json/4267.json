You were one of those special people that helped change\nthe very shape of the world we live in. I, like countless others, have been\ninspired by you, followed your career with fascination and will miss you. I\nknow I am but one anonymous voice out of millions whom you never met in this\nlife, but it is with deep sadness that I bid you farewell and extend my\nsympathies to your family, friends, and colleagues. May your \"insanely\ngreat\" spirit always live on.","header":"Deepest condolences","author":"Michael","location":""}
