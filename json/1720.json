{"mainText":"I am just an 18 year old man who is extremely happy with his Apple \nproducts.  But I would hope that someone from Jobs' family will read \nthis.  I have always thought that Steve Jobs was one of the most genius, \nintellectual, master of his craft, people of our modern society.  He was \ntruly a perfect human being.  I read that he took 1 dollar a year for \nsalary.  I'm sure that has only been for a limited time, but the fact \nthat that was the type of person he was says a lot.  Jobs was a god of \ntechnology and one hell of a great guy.  I wish I could have met him \nmyself.  He will be missed by  everyone.  I hope Jobs' family will be \nable to deal with their loss positively.\n\n\nSincerely, someone who actually cares.\n","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Connor","location":""}
