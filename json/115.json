{"mainText":"Dear Apple/whomever will read this,\n\nI grew up watching Steve launch new products in the way only he can ever do. He was and still is my childhood hero and taught me to always reach for the stars. His message was subtle but clear: you determine your future, make it worth every second and live life to it's fullest. It was through the keynotes I'd stay home from school to watch and save every penny I earned to buy anything Steve launched, that I learned to follow my dreams. Steve, wherever you are now, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for being everything you were and an amazing role model for me, even though the closest I ever got to meeting you was sneaking into a WWDC Keynote in 2003. The world has lost the most innovative and creative person to grace the modern world and I've lost a personal hero. RIP Steve. You will be missed severely.","header":"","author":"Nick","location":""}
