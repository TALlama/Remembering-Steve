{"mainText":"Whenever I thought about the challenges that faced me or the failures \nthat pop up in my life, one of the favorite stories I'd always go back \nto is the one of Steve Jobs. His sheer genius is one that is truly \ninspiring and how he returned to Apple to make it what it is today is \nsomething I tell all of my students whenever they execute their business \nplans. My friends and I are deeply saddened by this loss. The world has lost \none of the greatest visionaries of the century. Rest in peace Steve \nJobs. You will be missed by people across the globe.\n","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Lorenzo","location":""}
