{"mainText":"I'm sure thousands of emails and messages will flow for a long time, but \nI just want to say that Steve Jobs inspired many of us to look towards \nthe world of technology and being practical.  Although many have been \nskeptical about Apple and their journey, but I have been a true believer \nof a visionary, Steve Jobs.\n\nNow losing a loved one is not easy and I'm certain that the family is \nhurt, but please understand that there are millions that look up to \nSteve and envision him as the most important individual that has ever \nstepped this world.  He will now rest in peace and his visions will live \non through all of those who he has mentored, inspired and touched in one \nway or the other.\n\nGod Bless!","header":"My regards to the family...","author":"Jorge","location":"from Florida"}
