{"mainText":"Steve Jobs didn't know me, but he didn't need to. He still changed my life.\nAs a graduating college student with a degree in Creative Writing, as a\nsongwriter, and as a self-producing musician, Steve Jobs, through his\ninnovations with Apple, has altered what I do on every level--as a poet, as\na guitarist, and as someone who just wants to use computers without thinking\nabout them as computers. Steve Jobs was the man who made me believe that\ncomputers are not inherently evil. He has inspired me to be an innovator, to\nfollow my own passionates, risking it all on what I know is the right thing.\nApple has a gap which can't be filled; but that only underscores the\nimportance of this man: he has left something behind bigger than just one\nman's mortality. Apple can't help but continue being innovators in its\nfield. Jobs is still alive in Apple, in everything it does at every level.&nbsp;","header":"He Changed Us All","author":"Jonathan","location":""}
