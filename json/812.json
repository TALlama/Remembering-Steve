{"mainText":"I was introduced to my first computer, and apple II when i was 12 years \nold at my uncles house and have been a computer geek and mac lover ever \nsince.  I may not always agree with a policy or a plan but i cannot \ndismiss how much change has transpired because of Steve's vision and \nleadership.  He was an amazing man that is in short supply in this world \nand his impact will be felt for generations to come.  I am truly sorry \nfor his families loss and for apple's loss.","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Nick","location":""}
