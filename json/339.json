{"mainText":"Thank you Apple for creating such magnificent products.\nOnce you go Mac you never go back.\nSteve Jobs will be remembered, not for his amazing products, but for who \nhe was.\nI recently purchased my Mac Book Pro last April, and i must say i have \nbeen wanting it for as long as i can remember. It truly is an amazing \nlaptop, but it's more. Thank you Apple for the IPod Touch, Ipad 2, \nMacBook Pro, IMAC and many more wonderful products.\nCheers!&nbsp;","header":"Macs.","author":"Sophia","location":""}
