{"mainText":"The iPhone that Steve Jobs has created has been more than a huge part of my life, as well as many other peoples. Only someone with a mind as brilliant as his could provide the world with technology with the capabilities instilled in all of the apple products. Even though not many of us were able to meet Steve Jobs or get to know him personally, everytime someone picks up an iPhone, iPod, or iPad it will be used in memory of Steve. As we continue to upgrade with Apple, every purchase, phone call, text, and download will be figuratively dialing into Steve's soul. These devices are now more than a phone, tablet, computer, and walkman, we all have a piece of Steve Jobs. Tech God.","header":"Condolences","author":"Craig","location":""}
