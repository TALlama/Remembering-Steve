{"mainText":"For Steve\nYou were a revolutionary pioneer who has changed my life for the better\nI own an iPod, iPhone, Macbook Pro and am buying the iPhone 4S.\nYou made things simpler and have changed the world.\nYou were a great gift given to us all and taken from us so suddenly, you \nwill be a legend and live on in my heart as a student currently studying \nComputer Science at Queen Mary University of London who chose this path \nthanks to your style and inspiring charisma.\nI will greatly miss your presence, it will never be the same. I hope \nApple will live on with your values and vision and will never forget how \nyou made it what it is today.\nA special man.
