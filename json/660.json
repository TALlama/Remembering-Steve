{"mainText":"I never knew Steve Jobs but he had a huge impact on me and my family. We bought our first Apple product, Apple IIE in 1985. We couldn't afford it, but we grabbed onto the future. I and two of my children directly built careers working on Macs. We've all enjoyed the ride and he'll be missed. What an amazing person!\nWe'll never know how much.\n\n\nGood luck to Apple.&nbsp;","header":"So sad","author":"Deborah","location":""}
