{"mainText":"Steve Jobs, I and my family will remember you forever, and mourn for many days to come. You were the genius of our time, innovative and intuitive. What you have done for us will never be forgotten. You will never be forgotten. We mourn your loss today and have one wish: that you had overcome your illness and were sill with us today. It was you who brought Apple to where they are today, you who created the most advanced computer company for the average consumer. And it will be you who will never be forgotten. Thank you, Steve.","header":"The Genius of our Time","author":"Bryan","location":""}
