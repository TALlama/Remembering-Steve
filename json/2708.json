{"mainText":"My best wishes and condolences to Mr. Jobs' family.\n\nI can't claim to have known Steve personally, but through his\ninventions I feel like I've been touched by him. In our home, we wait\nfor a new Apple device to be delivered as if it were Christmas. My\nwife and I get so much joy from unboxing what I really consider to be\ngifts, even though we pay for them.\n\nI'm happy that such a great visionary was able to see his company\nsucceed so well, after experiencing so many challenges along the way.\nAt the same time I am very sad he lost his life so early. I've never\nhad to hold back tears at the loss of a business leader before, but I\nthink for everyone who felt they knew him through his innovations, we\nmust all feel this way right now.\n\nThere is no doubt this man left the world a better place than he found it.\n\nThank You Mr. Jobs.","header":"Thank You","author":"Jason","location":""}
