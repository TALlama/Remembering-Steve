{"mainText":"As a happy consumer of Apple products, I feel that it is only right to say a\nfew words about the man that changed the way people use technology.\n\nSix months ago, I converted to a Mac. Prior to that day, I was a full\nsupporter of PC computers. Now, I wasn't one of those \"are you a Mac person\nor a PC person\" type, but now, more than ever, I AM that type of person. A\nMac person. And I've never been more grateful for the man who made it all\nhappen. All I ever wanted was a reliable computer that didn't freeze, make\nloud noises, delete my important documents, overheat, shut down, and break\ninto pieces.\n\nI finally have it.\n\nI have since been more involved in Apple updates, and the life of Steve\nJobs. I marveled at his accomplishments, his determination, his continuous\ngood nature and kind heart. A month ago, a friend of mine sent me a forward\nof Steve Job's \"Find What You Love\" speech at Stanford University. She hoped\nto ease my nerves before starting my professional degree. I felt inspired\nand motivated by his words and his message.\n\nI am deeply saddened by his passing and give my condolences to everyone that\nhas ever known him. I know he had so much more to contribute to this world.\n\nHere is to remembering Steve.\n","header":"Here is to remembering Steve","author":"Matea","location":""}
