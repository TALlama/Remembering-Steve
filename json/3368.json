You changed the world in so many countless ways.  \nAside from the massive technological advances, just what this whole \nworld and society would be like without your touch; i don't want to \nimagine it.  I'm 17 years old, and i'd like to say thank you.  I've \nalways looked up to you, and you have deeply effected my life. Your view on \neverything, your strive for simplistic beauty, it was amazing. I feel \nhonored to be able to say that I lived while you did.  You were an \namazing man.&nbsp;","header":"My friend","author":"Joe","location":""}
