{"mainText":"Our hearts, thoughts, prayers go out to the Jobs family.  We were hoping \nSteve would be able to beat his illness.\n\nWe are a family of six who have lived through the Macintosh generations \nbeginning with one of the original Apple Macintosh computers.  We \nstepped our way up to the PowerBook G4 and now everyone owns their own \nMac computer, everyone has their own iPhone, and everyone has their own \niPod.  We also own an iPad 2.   How wonderful for us to be living during \nthis innovative time.  How wonderful the contributions Steve Jobs has \nmade.  His foresight, his intelligence, his management skills will never \nbe forgotten.\n\nThank you Steve Jobs.\n","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Joan","location":""}
