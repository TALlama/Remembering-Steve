{"mainText":"I wan't to write about my intense sadness on the passing of Steve Jobs. \nI have been a Pc user for some years but I changed over to Mac about 5 \nyears ago. In the recent past I have watched Steve's presentations and was totally \nin awe of the man - the passion he felt, and was able to impart to the \nviewers about the Mac product range was incredible. He was able to \nmarket products that are \"ground breakers\" in the technology and AI \nfields. He has made computers available to the world that truly reflect \nthe way that humans want to interact with technology - that make life \neasier, more fun and  artistic.\nMy sincere sympathy to Steve's family and his work colleges. Steve has \nleft one of the finest memories to mankind. I know his memory will live \non through the Mac products we have to date and the future products that \nhis fantastic team will release in the years ahead.\nGod Bless you Steve.","header":"Steve's Passing","author":"Colin","location":"from Australia"}
