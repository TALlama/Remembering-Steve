{"mainText":"I am deeply sad to find out Jobs passed away this morning. He and his spirit is going to be with us forever. Thanks so much for creating so many wonderful and amazing Apple things for us, which made a big change in my life and others around me. Thanks for so many great presentations which I shared with my students in a China English language learning class. Those presentations helped me and my students to learn things in many ways beyond learning a foreign language. We see the innovation, spirit and inspiration through all of them. Thanks for making the world better. \n","header":"Steve Jobs is with us forever","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
