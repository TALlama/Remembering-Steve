{"mainText":"We are deeply moved and mourn Steve's loss. Just touched that we don't have words. As I write this email, my wife is heartbroken, while I hold my tears back and my head cant think clearly. We don't&nbsp; know how we will break this news to our 8 year son who was aghast when he learnt that Steve is unwell with cancer.\n\nWe used Apple products at home but seemed so close to Apple and Steve in particular. Steve was a great innovator, thinker, leader, presenter. We wish well to the Apple employees, management to ride this tough time. Although a creative genius is gone, we are sure Apple will rise above this huge loss. As Steve said, \"Stay hungry, Stay Foolish\".\n\n\nMay Steve's great soul rest in peace.\n\nYou will be in our hearts till we turn to ashes.","header":"Condolences","author":"Seshadri Family","location":"from Phoenixville, PA"}
