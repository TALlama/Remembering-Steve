That was the time before I knew about Steve Jobs.\nWhat he said in Stanford Commencement Speech 2005 gave me guidance and inspiration.\nThe first iPhone I bought, the 3GS, inspired me. I had never seen something so amazing in my life.\nSteve Jobs have showed me that I can do great things if I love what I do.\n \nThank you, thank you, thank you, Steve!\n\nTo Steve's family, thank you, and be strong, and be proud.
