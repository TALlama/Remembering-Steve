{"mainText":"My name is Michael. Steve Jobs is a mentor to me. Everybody at work and \nall my friends, I would tell them to buy Macs, Ipads, and Iphones. I \nwould always bring up Mr. jobs. Without Steve Jobs the world would not \nbe the same. He has changed what cell phones look like and what they can \ndo. The IPad and the Iphone are two greatest inventions. Steve Jobs name \nwill never be forgotten. I feel bad that he had a form of pancreatic \ncancer. I am so sorry that everyone loss him to early. I feel so bad for \nhis family and close friends. My heart is broken, Mr Steve Jobs will \nforever be in my heart.  I am so sad for this loss.","header":"LOSS OF STEVE JOBS","author":"Michael","location":""}
