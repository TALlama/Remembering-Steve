{"mainText":"I bought my first computer while I was going to college to become a graphic designer in the mid 1990s. I looked over many machines to ponder which to buy. I looked at a PC and felt like I was all thumbs. I looked over a Mac and knew instantly what to do and discovered quickly all the magic this wondrous machine offered. \n\nI bought my first Mac and never looked back.\n\nI've turned down several job offers simply because those offices worked on PC's. What creative person would dare touch a PC and truly feel they were getting the best tool to perform creatively in a creatively driven business.\n\nThank you Steve Jobs... Thank you for challenging the world and truly making a difference.&nbsp;","header":"Remembering","author":"Dairen&nbsp;","location":""}
