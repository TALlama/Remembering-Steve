{"mainText":"Dear Mr Jobs,\n\nThank you for all you have done. Your vision and brilliance have changed the\nworld forever. I remember back in the early 1980's when I first used an\nApple Lisa computer. I thought to myself at the time in my early teenage\nyears. This is going to change the world. And you did. Bravo! You will be\nmissed but your legacy will live on and inspire new visionaries and bright\nminds to follow in your footsteps.\n\nMy condolences to your family. I recently lost my mother to pancreatic\ncancer and I understand what you and your family where going through.","header":"Thank You!","author":"Manny","location":""}
