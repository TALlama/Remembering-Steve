{"mainText":"I was greatly saddened by the passing of Steve Jobs.  I remember the days of\nthe garage group and how a dream mushroomed to something wonderful and\ncreative for the world to use and enjoy.   My first computers were Apple\nII's. In the near future I hope to expand my creativity by going back to\nApple and the iMac.\n\n \n\nSteve Jobs may have passed but his spirit and drive will continue with Apple\nnot only as a corporation but its philosophy on bringing exciting and\ninnovative products to the world.\n\n \n\nSteve was a private person but in the end his very being will always be\npresent to the public for his contributions not only in the computer world\nbut the world itself.\n\n \n\nMy deepest condolences to his family and to his friends.\n\n \n\nRest in Peace.&nbsp;","header":"Rest in peace","author":"Larry","location":""}
