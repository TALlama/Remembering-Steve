{"mainText":"It is impossible to say what Steve Jobs has meant in the life of our family.\n We have nothing but Apple computers in our home. We all would have nothing but Apple products for all of our communications. As a result of the iPad, we\n have planned and executed a small business. Steve Jobs has been a constant inspiration for well over twenty years to our family. We are grief-stricken at his death as we would be for a family member because he has been an import\nant part of our family for such a long time. Thank you, Steve.","header":"Part of our family","author":"Phyllis","location":""}
