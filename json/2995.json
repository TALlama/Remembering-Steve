{"mainText":"When I bought the Mac in 1984, little did I know it was just the beginning of my love affair with Apple.  Steve has changed my life for the better , and I am so thankful for his vision.\nOne of my biggest goals was to work for Apple.  I am so grateful that I worked for Apple for 4 years part time.   I loved every minute. The people I worked with are family, and I know my family is feeling a great loss today.\nThank you, Steve for all the Joy you have brought to all of us who use your creations.","header":"Steve","author":"Eddie","location":""}
