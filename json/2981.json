{"mainText":"I am very pleased with the success of Apple and the man who\ncreated it. Because of our beloved Steve, he created a technology company\nthat I believe, will not be surpassed by any other \"trying hard\" companies\nfor years to come. He just didn't create a line of exotic products that made\nApple so unique from other rivals; but also an icon that is very well\nrecognized by almost every technology geeks out there. All of the current\ncreations of devices from other companies that are trying to imitate the\nlook and feel of Apple products are a great example of a sign that defines\nhow powerful Apple, Inc. and Steve is; very influential. I'm still on my\nfirst Apple product, the iPod touch 4gen, and I absolutely adore it that it\nis always within 5 ft of me 24/7. Owning a first Apple product is a tech\nnirvana and I will always look forward to your remarkable, outstanding, and world class company.&nbsp;","header":"condolence","author":"Bryan","location":""}
