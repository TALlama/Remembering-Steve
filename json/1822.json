{"mainText":"As a fan of technology, I always saw Steve Jobs as a pure visionary, and the guy who defeated all the naysayers. He brought technology to a whole new level. I also think that Apple is, quite frankly, one of the most awesome companies out there. So when I heard that Mr. Jobs had passed away, I was shocked beyond belief. However, I have hope that Apple will still create fantastic technology that will further astound people with its ingenuity. I give my best wishes to Mr. Job's family and friends, and I wish them all the best in this time. May Mr. Jobs rest in peace.&nbsp;","header":"Dear Apple","author":"Zvi","location":""}
