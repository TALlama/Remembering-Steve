{"mainText":"A brilliant mind and true visionary.  Steve will be truly missed from a fan who has viewed him as this generation's leader toward a future that we have only dreamed of. My hope is for Apple to continue its drive towards the very same vision that Steve had worked so hard to achieve.\n\nMay all that believed in, continue to believe in, the impact that Steve Jobs\n has had on our lives over the past three decades. May Apple continue to strive towards Steve's vision in his memory. I truly believe that our world would not have achieved the technological advances had it not been for Steve's vision.\n\nMay his family know that I give to them, with sincerest respect, my condolences.  The world will remember where they were the day that Steve passed away.  His legacy will live on because it has to.","header":"My Tribute to Steve Jobs","author":"Marc","location":""}
