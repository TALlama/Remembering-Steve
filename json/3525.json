{"mainText":"I would like to offer my condolences to Steve's family, friends and work colleagues.\n\nWhile I never had the opportunity to meet Steve personally, I am more than a\nware of the way that he changed the game. Steve was an innovator and knew how to get things done. Apple have lost a visionary, a true genius.\n\nSteve brought about many changes in the computing world, we all know what a mouse is (thanks Steve). We all know what an iPod is. Many people own something he had creative insight on.\n\nWhile Apple will continue on strong, I hope they are able to continue on stronger knowing that Steve's memory will never be forgotten by all those who ever purchased or used an Apple device. The proud, the humbled and the grateful.\n\nThank you Steve, my wishes are with everybody who knew this wonderful man.","header":"Condolences","author":"Robert","location":""}
