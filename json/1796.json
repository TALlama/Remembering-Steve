{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was truly a remarkable human being. His contributions to the computer world were more than innovative, they made people's lives better and brought technology to a whole new level. He made Apple products one of the few\n in the world that not only did everything he said they would do, but even more. He made technology fun and easy to work with. This is what made his very first computers so popular. He cared about people and will be greatly missed by me and many others.&nbsp;","header":"With Sympathy","author":"Rick","location":""}
