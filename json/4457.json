{"mainText":"Dear Apple,\n\nSteve is my role model for years, and I... I really can't say anything. &nbsp;I'm a huge fan of Steve Jobs and Apple too. I was\npreparing to go to bed, and in the bed I saw this horrible news.\nI don't have much money but in the last year I collected enough money to buy\nthe iPhone 4. I was really proud (and I'm still so proud) to have my first\niPhone which was presented by the big Steve Jobs who is my idol for long\ntime.\nSteve made me think different. Yes. It's true. He proved that the precise\ndetails are also very, very important in life. He had the ability to make\nmagic in computer science and in people's life too. He will be mourned by\nmillions of people with me. I'm sure. I'm so sad now...\n\nThank You, Steve Jobs. Rest in Peace.\n","header":"I'm sorry for our loss - It's really painful for me in Hungary too","author":"Tamas","location":"from Sheetal"}
