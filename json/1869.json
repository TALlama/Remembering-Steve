Because of Steve\nJobs and John Ives, I am going to Carnegie Mellon for industrial design. I\nwant to thank them so much, more than can be expressed in an email.\n\n‎\"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found\nit yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll\nknow when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better\nand better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t\nsettle.\"","header":"Influence","author":"Karyn","location":""}
