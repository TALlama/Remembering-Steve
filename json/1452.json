{"mainText":"My life would not be what it is with out Apple and Steve Jobs. I learned math on a power mac.  I learned my trade on an iMac. I send my wife love on an iPhone. I'm inspired by the music on my iPod. I write on a Macbook Pro. I dream of one day owning an iPad. Through these devices I see the world, a world changed for the better, because of Steve. Long live Apple. And thank you Steve you will be remembered always.","header":"Thank you Steve","author":"Zach","location":"from Upperco, MD"}
