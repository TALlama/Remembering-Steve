{"mainText":"Dear Apple family\n\nWe would like to extend to you our deepest condolences for the lost of  \none, who, as we here always try to push the boundaries.  \nOne without who there wouldn't be a working model in the digital economy  \nfor us, the independent music executives out of all corners of the world.\n\nWe are so very proud to be given a opportunity to work with Apple iTunes  \ndirectly and so consider ourselves part of your family. On that note, as  \nBrazilians, we do believe in reincarnation and by doing so know that Steve  \nis at a much better place as well as that he is here; Right there at his  \noffice, looking at some figures and planning new designs as they come to  \nhim.\n\nGod bless him and all at Apple.","header":"To me maestro our deepest condole","author":"Afonso","location":"from SÃ£o Paulo"}
