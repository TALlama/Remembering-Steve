{"mainText":"I was devastated to hear the news that my favorite tech visionary had \npassed away.  I hoped it was just a rumor, but now I see that it is \ntrue via Apple's homepage.  Steve, you were to the personal computing \nexperience what Nikola Tesla was to electricity: the genius that would \nnever settle for the \"status\" quo, who instead of improving bad ideas \nwould come up with new solutions.  The consumer technological landscape \nwas carved by the rivers of creativity and innovation brought by you and \nthe Apple family.  as a true \"Apple-only\" consumer and computer engineer \nI can say that the world, and our field is a less beautiful place \nwithout you.  My heart goes out to your family, and to the Apple family.\n Deepest condolences and may you rest in blissful peace.&nbsp;","header":"Rest in Peace","author":"Jon","location":"from Oregon"}
