{"mainText":"Just yesterday I wrote my first blog, aptly named \"My obsession with \nSteve Jobs\". Had I known we would lose him forever, I would have kept \ngoing. I am humbled by Steve Jobs. I never met him, nor will I ever, but \nhe will hold a place in my heart. He changed our lives, he changed our \nWorld, and most importantly, he changed my kids' World. Thank you Steve, \nfor making our lives so fun. You will forever inspire me to be greater. \nThank you for making me want to be not only a better person, but also a \ngreater person. May God rest your soul.","header":"Thank you Steve.","author":"Kelly","location":""}
