{"mainText":"I remember the first iPod, I still have it because I love looking at how far\n apple has come from that point. A brick iPod to a sleek iPhone. Steve jobs was a genius and it breaks my heart to know someone so intelligent didn't stay on this earth for longer because he could have done so many more amazing things. He changed the world, and now that he's gone I think people are realizing how much of an impact he had on all our lives. He will live on forever through apple and I hope that brings some peace to his family and friends.","header":"","author":"Alex","location":""}
