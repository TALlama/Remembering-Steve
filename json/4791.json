{"mainText":"I just don't know what to say.  Words can't do justice to the accomplishments and change brought about by just one man, who regrettably and unfortunately died in his prime.  I only wish Steve can continue seeing the impact he has made, and the thriving of the company he has built. He envisioned a dream, and lived that dream as a true, sincere person.  As a CEO who was ousted from his own company, Steve picked himself up and continued taking steps forward.  As a returned veteran to a dream he calls home, he passionately revitalized a losing company with renewed vigour.  His accomplishments are his legacy, and his passion and attitude are our inspiration.  As much as I respect his achievements, it's his attitude, and genuine passion to live his life doing what he WANTS to do that I truly admire.","header":"Monumental loss","author":"Mark","location":""}
