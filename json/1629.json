{"mainText":"I just want to say thanks Steve for creating Apple. I own a MacBook Air and\n4 iPods, and I can't tell you how important these devices are to my life. My\nmusic, my thoughts, my memories, everything is there. And that wouldn't be\npossible without the work of Steve Jobs and of you guys at Apple. So again\nthank you a million times for improving my life, and I want to give you my\nheartfelt condolences in this sad day.&nbsp;","header":"Condolences","author":"Maria","location":"from Bogota, Colombia"}
