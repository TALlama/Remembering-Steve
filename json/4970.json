{"mainText":"Steve Jobs was a great visionary. He created a company and took it further than anybody else could have. I was ten when the&nbsp;iPhone&nbsp;came out, and&nbsp;even&nbsp;then I was fascinated by the thing. The&nbsp;iPod Touch came soon after, and my family scraped together enough money for one. As time passed, the ties to my life deepened as I began to use Mac computers, fiddle around on the iOS devices, and learn more about the wonderful world of apple. I&nbsp;received&nbsp;the newest iPod Touch over the summer as a graduation gift, after begging my parents and constantly using our old and outdated model. I now use it for most of my fun, work, and everything in between. The way Steve Jobs touched my life was not by making me buy a product, but allowing me access to a wide world of technology. I now design games and try to learn as much as I can from the visionary teachings of Steve Jobs.\n\nR.I.P. STEVE JOBS","header":"I remember Steve Jobs","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
