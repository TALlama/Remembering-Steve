Many need to know Steve, years ago, was openly\nhonest about the three revolutions he saw in the Xerox lab: the mouse, the\nGUI (drop down menus), and the computer network. His ability to see genius\nin others and other people's creations is perhaps, his most hidden legacy.\nSteve set the tone of vision, inventiveness, and creativity which the genius\nof Apple's people manifested.

May God give Apple and related companies\nthe grace and favor for continued genius and success for the next thousand\nyears.\n","header":"Steve leaves, but Apple continues.....","author":"James","location":""}
