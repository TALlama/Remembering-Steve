{"mainText":"I am so saddened to learn of Steve's passing.  It's strange to realize that you can feel such a loss for someone you never knew.  Having said that, his genius touched the lives of so many, and I suspect many people also feel that they knew him in some way.  At a time when so many of our corporations lack true leaders, Steve Jobs stood in such stark contrast. His passion, his commitment, his drive, his creative genius, and his striving for perfection will be admired for many years to come.  To his Apple family, you have very big shoes to fill, and I wish you all the best and hope that you take great pride and find true gratification in pushing yourselves to take Apple to the next level.&nbsp;Thank you to Steve for sharing your genius with all of us.","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Ann","location":""}
