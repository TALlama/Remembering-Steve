{"mainText":"My heart goes out to the entire Jobs family and all of Apple. He was such a great inspiration to so many and even though I didn't personally know him, it\n feels like I lost my friend. I can barely even type this message without tears falling down my face. May God watch over his family and comfort them in this time of need. He was certainly way to young but maybe God needed help with his iPad...  RIP Steve Jobs, you will be missed!!!!&nbsp;","header":"Lots of Prayers","author":"Amanda","location":""}
