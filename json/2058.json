{"mainText":"My name is Ben and I'm 8. &nbsp;Steve Jobs was  \nmy hero like Derek Jeter. Steve Jobs helps the world and Derek Jeter  \nhelps the pitcher when he's doing bad he calms the pitcher down when  \nhe's stressed I think there is a similarity with these two amazing  \npeople. Steve Jobs changed the world, he did things no one can do, and  \nevery one's heart dropped when he was diagnosed with cancer. So the  \npoint is Steve Jobs will be remembered for ever like Babe Ruth or  \nThomas Jefferson. Now I hope Apple will invent and make thing like the  \niphone 5,6,7,8,9 and so on.\n\n\n","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Ben","location":"from Honolulu, Hawaii"}
