While I regret not being able to meet and thank the Apple team\nin person for these products, Mr. Jobs' attention to detail and passion for\nthese products is clearly visible with every swipe, tap and pinch I perform.\nThank you for allowing me the opportunity to give thanks through this\nmedium, and once again, my prayers are with you all.","header":"A True Hero","author":"Gary","location":""}
