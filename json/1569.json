{"mainText":"I was a Luddite. \n\nI graduated from college in the mid '80s without once using either the school's mainframe computer or any of the personal computers that were starting to appear in dorm rooms.\n\nI became a teacher who created tests and other class materials on a typewriter.\n\nAnd then, in the early '90s, I was assigned as a duty a period each day in our school's Mac Lab.\n\nAnd it changed my life.\n\nWithin a few months, I bought my first computer, a second-hand Mac Plus.\n\nAnd I've owned a long string of Macs ever since.\n\nThank you, Steve Jobs, for -- as Poe said -- daring to dream a dream that no one dared to dream before. Thank you for making the world a better place.","header":"","author":"Steven","location":""}
