{"mainText":"I am in tears as I write this. I just wanted to say that as a 17 year old student, I needed a positive role model in my life, and that's exactly what Steve was. His speeches, his inventions, his reshaping of the world, inspired me to try hard in school. He reminded me that the little details count and to always give nothing but my best. I will continue to try my best in life and make a difference. \n\nThank you Steve.\n\n\nAlmost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.&nbsp;","header":"Remember Steve","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
