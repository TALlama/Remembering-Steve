{"mainText":"I am heart broken... the world just got a little less bright.  As someone how runs his own business and does something he loves I felt a kinship with Steve even though we never met.  He hatched the most amazing plans and often against all odds... he would get away with it.  Somewhere in the back of my mind I thought he would somehow beat the odds when it came to his battle with cancer.  My wife and I just found out we are going to be parents and in what seem to be less hopeful times in the country (I am currently listening to the protests in lower Manhattan out my office window) and knowing that good ideas matter... that gives me hope for our child.  I would have loved to thank Steve for proving that to be true.  More than for the objects that, sure, lead to me enjoying my time more and helped me get more done with it... I would have liked to thank him for giving me that hope. \n\nTo whoever is reading these emails at Apple... its possible.  Please share this sentiment with those close to Steve.  I am just a customer... but he was so much more than a supplier.\n\nThank you Steve... &nbsp;","header":"Thank you Steve.","author":"Douglas","location":""}
