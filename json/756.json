{"mainText":"I was a copywriter for 20 yrs, always using Apple.  I continually explained\nto my now 17-year-old son how much better Apple was far easier to use and\nless restrictive.  Two Christmases ago, my son did the searching for my new\nlaptop, and my Mom gave it to me for Christmas.  Come Boxing Day with his\naccumulated money gifts, my son took advantage of the sales.  His first\npurchase was an Apple laptop.\n\nOnce again, Mr. Jobs, thank you for vision and determination.\n\nHopefully, we'll met in your next incarnation.&nbsp;","header":"Thank you, Mr. Jobs","author":"David","location":""}
