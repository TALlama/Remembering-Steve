{"mainText":"In 1985 I went to an open house at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto Ontario Canada. It was a High School trip and while there I saw the coolest thing, a computer that had actual graphics on the screen, a picture of a lion as I remember. It was my first look\nat a Macintosh computer. A couple friends had Apple IIs at home but I had never seen one running, this tiny computer with a handle and mouse totally hooked me on computers. I went on to take Advertising and desk top publishing in college, Apple is the industry\nstandard computer in this field. Steve was an inspiration to me, ignited my tech juices and passion. The world has lost a great entrepreneur, visionary and pioneer. His work helped change the way the world did everything.\nGoodbye Steve, God bless you and may the people you leave behind continue your legacy and take all that you have taught and given them onto bigger and better things in your memory.\n\nThank you,&nbsp;","header":"My memory of Apple","author":"David","location":""}
