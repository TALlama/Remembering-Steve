{"mainText":"To my friends at Apple,\n\nI have recently joined the Apple family. I must say I have felt welcome from\nthe start. Through the vision of Mr. Jobs, technology has improved our\nlives. I can honestly say, nothing has done more so recently for my family,\nfriends, and my education more than Apple products has.\n\nAll of us can appreciate what the company has done for the world. And all of\nus can be grateful that Mr. Jobs shared his vision and talents with us while\nhe was able to do so.\n\nMay you rest in peace, Steve.\n\nAnd thank you\n- for everything.","header":"Thank you","author":"Matt","location":"from Wisconsin"}
