{"mainText":"Steve Jobs has been so inspiring to me since I first got in touch with Apple\nat the beginning of this millenium. It actually led me to run my own blog\nabout Apple and its products. The news about his death has caught me, like\nmany others, completely off guard. Even if we all knew that this day would\ncome. I can't express the sadness that I feel about it. In his visions,\nideas and products Steve will always be with us. To his friends, colleagues\nand family I wish all the strength they need in these hard times.\n\nSteve has changed the world and all our lifes in a way that only few people\nare able to and his legacy will remain for all times.\n\nThanks, Steve! Rest in peace.","header":"RIP Steve. Thank you!","author":"Florian","location":""}
