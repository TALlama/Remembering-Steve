{"mainText":"Mr. Jobs, your products and ideas shape the world.\n\nAs a 14 year old, I was incredibly awed and excited at having my first Apple\nproduct. The sleekness of the design and functionality of my iPod filled me\nwith joy, and I would have no qualms against boasting it to my friends.\n\nMy childhood was defined by technology, and by Apple. You have played a\nmajor role in my life; directly or indirectly is irrelevant. For that, I\nthank you.\n\nMay the Apple, a product of your genius, shine forever.&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Angela","location":""}
