{"mainText":"This was my facebook post and my husband said I should send it to you.  \nWe really are sad for the loss. I am saddened by the loss of a wonderful man who has affected my life \ndeeply.  Steve Jobs made Apple a household name.  I remember when it was \nfighting for its life and Steve came back.  Mac geeks celebrated his \nreturn and I didn't really understand the significance. My husband \nalways built our computers, but I finally got my first Mac when I was \nlooking for a small laptop in 2003.  \nAfter seeing how well it worked, my husband surrendered and became a Mac user.  \nHe tells people, \"I fix pcs all day, I just want to come home to a \ncomputer that works.\"  Many, many Apple products later and many release \ndate lines later, we are BIG Apple users.  Steve Jobs is like a part of \nthe family.  We mourn his death, but rejoice that he is out of pain.  \nRIP Steve.\n","header":"You changed our lives","author":"Lisa","location":""}
