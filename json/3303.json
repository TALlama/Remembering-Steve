{"mainText":"Dear Apple Family,\n\nI was both shocked and saddened to hear the news of Steve Jobs' death. I did\nnot know him as a person but through his achievements he had done on Apple\nand Pixar. As I am writing this email staring on my IMac, I will always\nremember his words:\n\n*\"You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it\nis for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,\nand the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great\nwork. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you\nhaven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.\" Little did I know that these words helped to guide me to choose the career\npath that I always dreamed of. Indeed my journey and passion with the job is\njust starting out, but I really do hope that I will be able to do all my\nworks with the love and passion he had with Apple.\n\nPlease extend my sincere sympathy to your big family. My thoughts and\nprayers are with you all.\n\nI know you will miss him very much as we all will. I am thankful that I had\na part of him in my live and will continue to remember him as the great guy\nhe was.","header":"Condolence","author":"Cindy","location":""}
