{"mainText":"Hello, I just wanted to send condolences to his family and his work family. We have been fans of his work for many years. My daughter would say she loves the iphones..me its the itouch/ipod.There are not enough words to describe what he did for our ears(music) &amp; communication! Thank you for letting us express our sympathies this way. He'll probably take over wherever he is and change things up;) We lost a great person today... &nbsp;","header":"thank you","author":"Melissa","location":""}
