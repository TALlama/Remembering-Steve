{"mainText":"\n\n\n\nI'm from Lima - Peru, a college student of Communications. I would like to receive my most heartfelt condolences on the passing of Steve Jobs. Recently, in time for class, my teacher showed us a video that showed Mr. Jobs speaking at Stanford University, was from his own mouth that I found out he had overcome cancer, it is as if I had been introduced to a boy which was shocked by his genius and intelligence and I am sorry to hear that he died and that video I take it as a farewell because he knew he would die. I am touched. Rip Steve Jobs. \t\t \t   \t\t  ","header":"Condolences","author":"Melina","location":"from Lima, Peru"}
