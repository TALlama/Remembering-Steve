{"mainText":"Dear Apple Friends,\nI am truly saddened at this news.\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to Steve's Family, friends and co workers.\nI can honestly say that the addition of the products that I now use everyday are because of Steve's innovation, vision and uncanny ability to know what people want, and how to give that to them.\nI sit here in my office writing this note on my iMac, and I am surrounded by about 10 other Apple products, that i use everyday and have made my life easier, more focused and enjoyable.\nHis impact on my musical life alone, are immeasurable, and for that i am truly appreciative.\nI never had the pleasure to know him personally, but consider him a friend, as i'm sure many do!!\nMay you rest in peace and may your loved ones forever carry your spirit with them.\nSteve will be missed by me and millions of other people who's lives he touched in a similar way.","header":"Passing Of Steve Jobs","author":"James","location":""}
