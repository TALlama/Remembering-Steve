{"mainText":"Today the world lost a visionary, a man who worked hard to make the world a more fun place. He built a cult of die-hard fans who will NEVER give up their Apple computers. I thank him for that, my wife thanks him for that, and my kids thank him for that. Steve Jobs was one of a kind, a genius and a hero to people everywhere. RIP Steve, you will be greatly missed as we all loved you.&nbsp;","header":"Condolences","author":"Jeff","location":""}
