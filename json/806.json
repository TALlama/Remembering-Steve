{"mainText":"\nDear Jobs Family and Apple Employees,\n\nIt is extremely sad and devastating to hear of Steve Job leaving the \nworld.  He changed the world in so many ways and I am certain he had much \nmore to give - and yet he passed away at age of only 56. Immense \naccomplishments and an amazing human being. His 2005 Stanford speech is \nstill vivid in my memory and ringing in my ears. May his family be well \nand his soul rest in peace. God bless him.","header":"Condolences to Steve's family, both his own and the larger one at Apple","author":"Vijay","location":""}
