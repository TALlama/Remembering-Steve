{"mainText":"I feel like I've lost a good friend. It is a sad day, but all of our lives have been made better by Mr. Jobs. I would like to call him Steve just because he has been a part of my life since the mid 80s!\n\nThere will only be one Steve Jobs, but his influence may hopefully inspire others to try to follow his lofty goals. I would like to wish his family all the best in this time of grief. With time, that grief will hopefully be tempered with the immense pride in being a part of his remarkable life! You are truly so fortunate to have been so close\n to such a great human being. My life would be completely different without Steve Jobs and not just because of his devices, but in the work that I do every day. From the bottom of my heart, thank you Steve!\n\nMy heartfelt condolences and best wishes!&nbsp;","header":"Bye Mr. Jobs - we will miss you greatly!!","author":"Howard","location":""}
