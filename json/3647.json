{"mainText":"I'm just a kid who attends Rutgers University. I never knew Mr. Jobs personally, but I didn't have to, to understand how amazing he was. It's shocking, but I am actually crying because Mr. Jobs has died. There was so much more life for him to live. So much more to do, to make this world a better place. Steve Jobs you will never be forgotten!! \n\nR.I.P. Mr. Jobs, and long live Apple!","header":"One of the most amazing humans to walk this earth!","author":"Sagar","location":""}
