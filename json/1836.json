{"mainText":"For me, Steve Jobs wasn't a hero or an idol.  He was the man that made my\ndreams come true.  From when I was a little boy and got my first word\nprocessor, learned to program in BASIC, I dreamed of portable computers.\n Tiny little laptops, tablet computers...  I won't lie, I never could have\ndreamed of the iphone, but when it first came out, that's what it felt like.\n Like science fiction had been made real.\n\nI feel like someone just told me that Santa Claus isn't real.  Like there's\nno more magic in the world.\n\nApple will continue to develop and release wonderful products.  I just don't\nknow if they, or anything else, will ever capture our imagination again the\nway Steve was able to.\n","header":"","author":"John","location":""}
