I \nalways look forward to see him present or introduce a product. Thank \nyou, Mr. Jobs. I may only be thirteen, but I know a great man when I see \none. I am sorry, Mrs. Jobs for the loss of your husband. I wish I got to \nmeet him. Thank you, Mr. Jobs for \"A\"s on my projects. Thank you for \ninspiring me to be a great person. Mr. Jobs' death is a terrible event. \nThe world will miss you, Steve Jobs.\n","header":"The Greatest Man to Ever Live","author":"Connor","location":""}
