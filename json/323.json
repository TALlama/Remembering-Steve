{"mainText":"I want to start with sending my condolences to Steve's family and friends in\nthis difficult time.\n\nI've been working for Apple for almost 4 years now and it has been one of\nthe most enriching and most rewarding carrers I've ever pursued. Working for\na company that I love and stand behind, like no other.\nEven before I started working for Apple Retail, I admired the way Steve grew\nand developed this company and his ability to present and excite the world\nwith some of the best innovations Apple has ever created. Getting hired by\nApple was a dream come true.\nI am proud to be able to say:  \"I work for Steve Jobs,\" one of the most\ninspiring leaders, mentors and innovators of our time. He built a company\nthat respects and values its employees and customers in a way I've never\nseen any other company do. We are reminded of him every day by using the way\nhe taught us to do business.&nbsp;","header":"He'll always be remembered.","author":"Christoph","location":"from Boulder, Colorado"}
