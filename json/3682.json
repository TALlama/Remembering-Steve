{"mainText":"I'll always miss Steve. He was an inspiration for me to do the best I can and more in everything I did. He was the person that I looked to when I wanted to \"think different.\" A true legend in creativity and business combined has been lost today and there will never be another person like him. Thank you for helping me to where I am now, Steve.","header":"RIP","author":"Kelly","location":""}
