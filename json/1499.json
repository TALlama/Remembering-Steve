{"mainText":"The world has lost a creative genius tonight that no one can ever  \nreplace. I was encouraged by my brother to switch from PC to Mac in  \n2007. I'd hesitated for years thinking I'd never figure 'it' out even  \nthough my Art Director brother kept promising me Macs were user- \nfriendly. My world opened up after I purchased my iMac. I'll never  \nlook back. I'll keep creating and honoring Mr. Jobs along the way, I  \nhope.\n\nThank you Steve Jobs. You will be sorely missed.","header":"A simple statement of thanks.","author":"Linda","location":"from Louisville, Kentucky"}
