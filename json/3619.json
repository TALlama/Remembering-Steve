{"mainText":"To Mr Jobs family and friends,\n\nLike many, I was saddened tonight to learn about the death of Steve \nJobs. We lost someone who revolutionized the world as we, or at least I, know \nit. My first computer was a Mac Classic, that I still own to that day. \nNot only the products created by Apple but the vision of this man and \nthe company he built shaped so many of the things we use on a day to day \nbasis. People using Apple products learned to \"Think Different\" and I \ntry to do that everyday. I'm glad I got to live during a time where I \ncould see the body of his work and vision come to life. My thoughts are with his family and all those who feel saddened by his \ndeath.","header":"Condolences","author":"David","location":""}
