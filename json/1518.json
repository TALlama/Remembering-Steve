{"mainText":"It saddens me deeply to hear of the passing of this awe inspiring creative talent. Steve Jobs was a true innovator! I was always like a kid on Christmas\n morning when he was about to unveil Apple's next big thing. I will always admire the design of his products and the ability to always be ahead of the competition. It should also be said, that even when the competition tried to copy, they fell way short! Congratulations on a truly lived life! I hope to feel \"Christmas morning\" again in your absence.\n\nRIP Steve!","header":"Heartfelt Condolences","author":"Paul","location":""}
