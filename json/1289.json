{"mainText":"I have owned Apple products my whole life: from an Apple II, to a Mac 512k Enhanced, to a Performa 6300, to a Powerbook 500, to a Mac G4, to a Powerbook G4, to a 60GB Video iPod, to the original iPhone, to an iPod Shuffle, to the iPod Touch, and to an 8-Core MacPro and a MacMini. Back in the day, I even remember looking longingly at the Lisa during a trade show!\n\nI don't consider myself a \"fanboy\" by any means. I can be quite critical of Apple products; oftentimes frustrated by the company's decisions.\n\nSo why keep buying Apple products?\n\nBecause they work for me.\n\nThank you, Steve, for providing me with the tools that have consistently made my life better.\n\nAnd I look forward to a great future for your beloved company.","header":"Rest in Peace, Steve","author":"Jake","location":""}
