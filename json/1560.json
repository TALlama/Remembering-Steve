As an Apple Fanboy (what my\nfriends call me), I am most grieved by Steve Jobs's death and I thought it\nwas really sad that he maybe didn't get to experience the new iphone 4s.\n Apple was really a great company and now is and always will be my most\nfavorite company in the world and Steve Jobs will always serve as an\ninspiration to me and I will never forget him.\n","header":"remembering steve jobs","author":"Anish","location":""}
