{"mainText":"I just want to say that I loved Steve Jobs. He was truly a visionary and a brilliant man. He has brought so much to the world. I know that he is in a better place and not in pain anymore, but he will be missed badly. I just can't believe our Steve is gone. Thank you Steve for creating such joy in so many peoples lives. My prayers are with the Jobs family. I will miss you Steve.&nbsp;","header":"I will miss you.","author":"Ryan","location":""}
