{"mainText":"My only hope is the Apple team and leaders will still have the vision \nand talent to carry on what Steve has left them. It seems that the new \nCEO and most of the top leadership have been with Steve for years; so \nthere is no excuse for a change of business philosophy or direction. \nThere are many competitors out there just waiting for any future  \nmistake that will take Apple down and let them keep making just adequate \nequipment and software which is improved little by little over decades \ninstead of real innovations...Apple style. Let's hope the present management will uphold Steve's legacy and keep \nApple the front runner it is as well as giving us the best experience in \nour digital lives that can be had.","header":"Apple's Future","author":"Virgil","location":"from Austin, Texas"}
