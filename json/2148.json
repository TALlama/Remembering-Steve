{"mainText":"I'm sitting here in front of my computer and cannot believe I'm this upset\nover the death of a man who I never met. But I'm slowly realizing that he\nwasn't just any man. I've listened to his 2005 Stanford commencement speech\nperhaps 20 times and his description of death is the most fitting\ntoday; \"death is very likely the single best invention of life.\" He finally\nbecame the \"old\" but paved the way for the \"new.\" An innovator, an\ninspiration to those with dreams of greatness, he led Apple to become the\nonly company that, in my opinion, got me to buy their products mainly\nbecause he introduced them. Truly a sad day.\n","header":"Irreplaceable","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
