{"mainText":"I have been on Mac for three years, but an avid follower for five. Apple has changed my life. Steve jobs is a source of huge inspiration to me, for his perseverance, and his charisma. He built Apple out of nothing, running from his parents garage. Every single time he went up on stage, or released news, he did it in only a way Steve Jobs could do so. He was a great man, a great businessman and a person whom I would have given anything to simply shake his hand and say thank you. \n\nMy thoughts are with Steves family, friends and colleagues\n\nGoodbye Steve. Thank you.","header":"Condolences","author":"Mark","location":""}
