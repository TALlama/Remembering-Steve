{"mainText":"Steve Jobs made my life better through his love of Apple, and it was because of his iMac\n and Final Cut Pro that I have such a love for filmmaking. If every CEO were\n like Steve Jobs, the world would be a better place and people would be inspired to live creatively every day. Thank you, and God bless your family, friends and everloving Apple family.","header":"Thank You Mr. Jobs","author":"Jasmyn","location":""}
