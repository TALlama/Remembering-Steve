{"mainText":"I am so saddened about Steve Jobs passing away at such a young age. I am almost the same age as him, and although, as a layman  I was never an expert in any of the hi tech stuff; but as a consumer I always admired him for his innovation, intelligence, design , and how easy his products were to use. Just the opposite otherâ€™s products that were designed without a thought, and cumbersome to use. It is so sad to imagine such a genius had to face and experience failure , and the stress he must have felt when seeing his company, producing the best product on the planet going bankrupt. It must have taken a toll. He is gone from this earth, but will be remembered and live forever. Great man indeed.&nbsp;","header":"love and admire this man","author":"Alireza&nbsp;","location":"from Canada"}
