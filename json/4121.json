{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\n\nI know you in a better place. Im sure it was very hard to go through \nwhat you did. I would just like to thank you for being a genuine person. \nYou created a system that people love so much. You are more than a \ninventor, you inspire people everywhere. Because of you I have been \npursing my dream in Sports media. I use Mac's to edit highlight tapes, I \nuse the iPhone to keep my games scheduled, and i use my iPad to carry my \nwork with me everywhere I go. I thank you for everything you have done. \nI will always miss you.\n\nPirates of Silicon Valley will always be my favorite movie.\n","header":"You inspired me","author":"Veronica&nbsp;","location":""}
