Without your genius, I could not listen to the worlds musical offerings whereever I go on my IPOD. Without your genius, I could not communicate with the word so efficiently on my IPHONE. Without your genius, I could not be entertained on demand with my Apple TV.\n\n\nYou have done your job. Rest in peace because you deserve it. You should be a happy being wherever you are.&nbsp;","header":"All I can say is thank you.","author":"Ellen","location":""}
