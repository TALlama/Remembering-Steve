{"mainText":"I don't even know Mr Jobs but certainly know all  about him.  He has changed the world we live in today with his visions and  his talent and I for one would be lost without my computer, etc.  My 6 yr.  old grandson is a genius with the computer already.  My sympathy to his  family and to his Apple family on your loss and everyone remember how he changed  the world and the way we think. I'm grateful for him!","header":"so sorry","author":"Dee","location":""}
