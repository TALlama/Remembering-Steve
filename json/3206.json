{"mainText":"I am the same age as Mr. Jobs and as a painter who also trained in \ncalligraphy with another Reed alumnus, I tell you that I feel a \nconnection with him and understand his drive to make the personal \ncomputer something beautiful. I can also say that without his computers, \nI would have almost no interest in them nor would I ever have seen them \nas creative tools. In short, his machines have changed my life for the \nbetter and my work on them has contributed, I hope, a little to the \nworld. My condolences to his family, and his larger one at Apple, and \nexpress my faith that we will see another person of such creative spirit \n in my lifetime.\n","header":"I feel deep sadness and gratitude tonight.","author":"Michael","location":""}
