{"mainText":"I am deeply saddened by the passing of Steve Jobs. I have loved Apple's \nproducts since my first introduction to the Macintosh Plus at the School \nof Design at North Carolina State University in 1982. In Steve Job's \nleadership at Apple, Next and Pixar, his dedication and insistence to \nalways do things the best way possible, and to produce the absolutely \nbest products possible stand out as a stellar achievement and a model \nfor others in all fields of endeavor. We will miss you, Steve. &nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Howard","location":"from Durham, North Carolina"}
