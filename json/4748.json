{"mainText":"I never knew Steve Jobs except as a figure in the news, but I've always been an Apple/Mac user since I computers first started showing up at school when I was small. Today, I work as a software developer, doing work that is so much more fun and fulfilling than I ever thought work could be, and if it weren't for my lifelong experiences using Apple products and, as a result, coming to expect that technology should be fun and accessible and intuitive and should really open up new worlds, I doubt I would be in the place I am now. Thank you Apple, and thank you Steve Jobs.","header":"","author":"Sarah","location":""}
