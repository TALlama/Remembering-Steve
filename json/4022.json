{"mainText":"At 36-years-old I can say I truly grew up with Apple; the very first computer I had the chance to use was an Apple IIe. When I was in 4th grade my mom transitioned from a kindergarten teacher to the computer coordinator in my Catholic school district, which allowed our family to be integrated into the continuous innovations of Apple. The exciting revolutions that Jobs orchestra led is a major influence on why I became a professor of technology. It only seems fitting that I learned about Mr. Jobs' passing from the AP wire app on my iPhone.\n\n It is truly a sad day.\n\nMy condolences to Steve Jobs' family and friends. His impact on society will\n carry on forever.","header":"Truly a sad day","author":"Michael","location":""}
