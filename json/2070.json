The universe will be sad for its loss of a genius and the most inspiring man living today, easily. \n\nI feel like I have lost a family member, a close friend-- someone who I can't explain how he has touched my life, but has in every way. \n\nRest In Peace Steve Jobs, I send good wishes for your family and will never forget you.
