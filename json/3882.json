{"mainText":"When I learned that Steve Jobs had passed away I literally shed tears. \nHe was inspirational. He was a man that changed the world as we know it. \nI feel like he wasn't only able to think \"inside the box\" or \"outside \nthe box\", but view \"the box\" as an entirely different object or element. \nSo here I am rambling about a man I've never known, typing about him on \na device that he made happen. Steve Jobs, you've lived the American \ndream and I admire you for that. My thoughts and concern go out to your \nfamily and friends.\n\nWith condolences, a grateful modern American.","header":"Tears for a \"Stranger\"","author":"Lauren","location":""}
