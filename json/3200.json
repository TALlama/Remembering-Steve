{"mainText":"\nHi Apple,\nI was so upset to hear that Steve Jobs had passed away! Steve has touched me through his ideas and his genius mind, you would not have to meet him in person to realise that he is a great human being just from watching him on Keynote videos you could tell how much he had to other the world and the apple organisation. I fill privileged to have been in the generation when the iPod and iPhone have been released, pushing the technology industry to its next level.\nRest In Peace Steve Jobs 1955-2011\n- Tom","header":"Steve Jobs RIP","author":"Tom","location":""}
