{"mainText":"Hi.\n\nWe have lost the greatest visionary of the modern era, and there will \nnever be another one like him.  All I can say is thank you, Steve.  \nThank you for the great memories and for making my life easier with the \nApple products you made possible that I use.  We will miss you a lot, \nand I say \"we\" because I feel that I am a part of Apple.  We must \ncontinue with his vision and his legacy cannot be forgotten.\n\nMy deepest condolences to his family,  his friends, and the Company.","header":"Remembering Steve Jobs","author":"Jose","location":""}
