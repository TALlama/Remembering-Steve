{"mainText":"Who was the one who I did not know,\nbut I could see him all around me,\nstreets, subway, airports, meetings, movie theaters, tv ads,\nhe was not there but his ideas were,\n&nbsp;\nInspiring, blindly forward-thinker, taught the industry how to think,\nhow to lead, how to be the first no matter what others said.\nYes, he did not do it alone but he inspire others to\nfollow him, sometimes in opposite directions. The world needs more Jobs, \"Steves Jobs\" to show us\nthat there is no end to an idea, there will be many other\nideas that will need to be created to solve our human being lives. Steve, wherever you are now, illuminate us who work\non new ideas everyday and look for WOW solutions for\nour lives. Thank you for inspiring me all these years!","header":"Rest In Peace!","author":"Sergio","location":""}
