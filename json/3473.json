{"mainText":"I am new to the Apple Family. I work in Apple Retail. Although I have only been with the company since November of 2010, there was a connection to Mr Jobs that is unexplainable. I recall on our 10th anniversary a video played at a meeting to commemorate the occasion. Mr Jobs said something that still rings in my ears.... It's the employees of Apple that make up the special sauce..... Steve built the recipe, he gave us the tools and the resources to make the sauce. My wish is that his vision continues to exceed all expectations. I am in my mid 50's... I work with a a wonderful eclectic group of young, intelligent folks. The brilliant youth of today has found a home, a safe haven within the Apple Community... the demographic is wide and accepting within our walls of white, glass and great lighting. Thank You Mr Jobs, for giving us the bright, the strange, the geek, the nerd, the mom, the retiree a home without bias!\n\n\n\n","header":"Rest In Peace Mr Steve Jobs","author":"Balka","location":"from New Jersey"}
