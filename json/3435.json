{"mainText":"As i Watched iJustine shed tears about Steve and talk about how he influenced her life and changed her life, i thought about what he did for mine. I think he changed mine as well, If not for him, and the rest of the creators at apple, my love for music would not have been as big, music is the most important thing in my life, if i was never introduced to iPods and stuff, i honestly don't know where i would be, it's the only music device i will ever use. I know my story isn't very impressive or anything but i felt i had to share it with the people who inspired me to be the way i am. I will never forget the thing he or any of the other creators have done for me. My condolences for his family and friends, and to all the other people he's inspired like myself.","header":"Inspire","author":"Tiffany","location":"from Albany, NY"}
