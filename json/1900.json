{"mainText":"Dear Steve Jobs,\n\nI have heard that you passed away some moments ago. I feel very sorry for\nthat.\n\nI want to tell you something that came to my mind just when I read the bad\nnews: there's no end for those who set up a beginning. This is because it is\nthat beginner behaviour what the World needs to go forward, not just\neconomically and technologically speaking, but also in the human sense. I\nremember now something you once said: “Being the richest man in the cemetery\ndoesn’t matter to me … Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something\nwonderful… that’s what matters to me.\" And certainly, you can rest forever\nwith the fact that you left a legacy of something wonderful, a better way of\nthinking and being.","header":"There's no end for those who set up a beginning","author":"Tareq","location":""}
