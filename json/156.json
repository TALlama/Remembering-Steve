{"mainText":"Being a Mac fan has been a part of my life for a long time. For three years in Middle school, in fact, it defined me: I was the Apple kid. It feels like... losing a favorite uncle who is also your personal hero. So I might sound pathetic when I write this... but it's what I feel. \n                Why must genius die so soon?\n           Is it because the stars that burn the brightest\n                           Burn the fastest, too?\n               Thank you, Steve, for lighting my life\n                            And so many others\n                  Your life's flame has gone out\n                But it will burn on in a million hearts\n                            That you ignited.","header":"The Lost Hero","author":"Daniel","location":""}
