{"mainText":"Let today, October 5th for always be remembered as the Steve Jobs Day. I \npraise the spirit of a man that changed the face of our generation. His \nvision inspired us, motivated us, and enabled us to become the \ngeneration we strive to become. Steve Jobs was a not only a pioneer, but a mentor to US: the youth of \ntoday's world. To every son or daughter who yearned for a strong role \nmodel we find it in him; a man that believed in us, a man who proved \nnothing to be impossible. His legacy has forever changed the future of our wonderful world. He \nleaves behind the platform for the unimaginable, the limitless, the true \ninner creative potential of all human beings on this planet, and for \nthat and all else, we will forever be grateful to you.\n\nThank you, Steve!\n\n\n\n","header":"To Steve","author":"Kristian","location":""}
