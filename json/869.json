{"mainText":"Growing up in Silicon Valley, I had the fortune of seeing the computing industry develop.  I touched my 1st keyboard at 8-years old in 1972 and fell in love with computers.  It was such an exciting time to see all the players, especially Apple battle it out and make their own unique products.\n\nYou were such a tremendous influence to all of us in the computing industry.   We owe you for the inspiration that drives us all   We saw you through thick and thin but were always behind you.  You have touched us all.  We are all better people for having known you.  You stuck to your vision and did it your way.\n\nI work in a IT Consulting Firm but am the consultant who get's all the Apple calls.   I will continue to be an Apple Evangellist as I truely believe in your vision.\nï»¿\nMay the Sun always warm your Face.\n\nAloha, Steve.&nbsp;","header":"Aloha Steve","author":"Mark","location":"from Danville, CA"}
