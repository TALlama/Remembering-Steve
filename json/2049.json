After being fired he returned\n to his company, only to make it the most valuable in the world. As I send this message from my iPhone, I am saddened.

The world has lost a great inventor, spokesperson,\n businessman, genius, human, and American. What Steve left behind can not be\n put into words.","header":"World at loss","author":"Patrick","location":""}
