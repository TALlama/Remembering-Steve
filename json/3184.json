{"mainText":"Dear All,\n\nThe news on Steve's death was the most shocking and saddening despite \nhis known desease...\n\nHe is one of those rare people, whose loss will affect millions of those \nwho didn't even know him personally. I hope his soul will rest in peace \nand God will reward him many folds for the huge positive and fruitful \nchange he's been introducing to mankind and the world for the years he'd \nbeen hosted on the Earth.\n\nMy deepest condolences to his family, friends and colleagues. I can't \nimagine the depth of their pain, if I, who never even met or knew Steve \npersonally feel such a pain.\n\nPlease accept this note as a tiny support in such a hard time.","header":"My deepest condolences","author":"Mukaddam","location":""}
