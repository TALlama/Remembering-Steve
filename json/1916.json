{"mainText":"Hi,\n\nMy name is Issi.\nIm from Sydney, Australia.\n\nI know how distant we are from each other but yet we feel so close at \nthis time of mourning.\n\nThe world has lost an incredible man, so inspirational and modest.\n\nThe way he changed peoples lives, not only though technology, but \nthrough sheer eccentricity and the radicalism of today world.\n\nTo the Jobs family, do not be shamed, Steve was an amazing man who \naccomplished so much. he lived his life to the full, and God decided \nthat his work was done on earth. He was an angel, but not ours to keep.\n\nMy thoughts go out to all mourners.","header":"Steve Jobs - the most inspirational man on earth","author":"Issi","location":""}
