{"mainText":"I sit at my my MacBook Pro and write this note with great sadness tonight. But then I have to remind myself, Steve will never die. Steve lives on - and always will - in millions of lives worldwide, in every song we listen, in every site we browse, in every line we type, in every phone conversation we have, in most everything we do in the course of our days. Most everyone I know owns at least one Apple product. Ours is an eternal tribute to an untiring genius.\nWe will remember you and be inspired by you, Steve. Always. Thank you for all you did for us. Rest in Peace.","header":"We already miss you, Steve","author":"Anonymous","location":""}
