{"mainText":"\tSteve Jobs defined a culture. I attend the George Washington \nUniversity; there is an Apple retail campus store in our bookstore and \nliterally every teacher has to face a sea of apples from the back of \nnearly every student's computer each day in class. I've always had Apple \nproducts -- various iPods and an iPad -- but only recently received a \nMacBook Pro for a college gift and I could ask for nothing more. I did not have not know Steve Jobs personally for his death to \naffect me. How he has changed the world is evident and upon hearing the \nnews I felt as if the world had somehow irreparably changed for the \nworse.\n","header":"","author":"Danielle","location":""}
