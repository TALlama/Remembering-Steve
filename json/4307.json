{"mainText":"I owe Steve the three most important things in this world. My wonderful life, made healthy again after illness with the support of my amazing Apple coworkers and the benefits we are provided.\nMy beautiful wife, whom I met while we were working at Apple. She's the best thing that has ever happened to me.\nMy perfect daughter, born less than one month ago.  \n\nI am forever in your debt, Steve. And I know that I'm not alone.  I know at least four other children here because of what you've helped build.\n\nI know that my talents helped me to be who I am but Steve gave me the tools to help get me there.\n\nI will miss you as though you are family. You will live on long after you have left us because people like me will tell our children about you and what you mean to us.\n\nThank you for everything.&nbsp;","header":"I owe Steve everything","author":"Jesse","location":""}
