{"mainText":"\nI'm sitting in a library in Orange County, California, and I just heard the bad news.  My heart goes out to Mr. Jobs' family and friends.  Now all that we are left with are our memories.  \n\nMy earliest forays into computing were as a young boy, with the Apple II computer.  It changed my world, and revolutionized what people believed computers were capable of.  Mr. Jobs never stopped stunning us with his creations, each one was more jaw-dropping than the last.  I hope his death will be a reminder of our own mortality, and that it will force us to do that which we have put off for far too long.  God bless you Mr. Jobs, and thank you for making the world a much more interesting place.","header":"Rest in Peace - Steve Jobs","author":"Mehrdad","location":""}
