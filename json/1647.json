{"mainText":"3 years ago, I got my first iPod nano, and I found I love this product. I started to buy them. I have nano, shuffle, touch, iPhone, iPad, MacBook, apple tv. I love all the products. And Steve Jobs is the most important memory of Apple. The black shirt, jean and the glasses. These are icons of apple. I'm so glad to see apple has became the most successful company in the world. I'm proud that I loved, love, will still love apple!\nThank you, Jobs! Thank you for bringing the perfect and wonderful products. I'll remember you. Rest in peace.&nbsp;","header":"Thank you, Steve Jobs","author":"Eric","location":""}
