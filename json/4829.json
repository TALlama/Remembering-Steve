{"mainText":"Ever since I was a young designer some 30 years ago, Steve Jobs \nredefined the possibilities of what we could achieve.\nHis vision and gift for understanding how we as can exceed the human \nboundaries and achieve was astounding to me. His clear prescient eye on the future denied any explanation.\n\nSteve was a cultural icon in my life that was a constant inspiration and \nsource of hope. In pursuit of extremely humanistic approaches to technology, he \nredefined for me the very way I thought about concept and design.\nAnd what it means to be human.\n\nTo be without his presence in our world is to have lost a man of near \nmythical character, who's only challenge left unbeaten was our inherent \nmortality.\n\nI will feel this hole in my heart &amp; soul for some time, for a world \nwithout Steve is ultimately less human.","header":"The Loss of our Friend and Mentor","author":"Ricardo&nbsp;","location":""}
