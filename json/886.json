{"mainText":"I just wanted to relay my heartfelt condolences to the Apple Family and Steve's family. I grew up, having been born in 1973, using Apple II's in school, lusted after my Algebra teachers PowerBook, managed to save enough money to buy a used Apple IIc in college and continued to marvel at the innovation that poured from Steve's mind in the ensuing years. At least in my life, Steve has had a most profound influence, even without ever having met him personally. His artful works, at Apple as well as Pixar, have brightened my life and my family's life. Even my son, of 9 years, knew full well the impact of losing Steve today. Steve has left an indelible mark on history. We will miss him greatly.","header":"Thanks Steve","author":"George","location":""}
