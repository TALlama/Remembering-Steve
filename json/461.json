Ever since I have loved  \nApple and his work, stuck with the company through the bad times and  \nsailed with him and the company when he came back! He has given the  \nworld a great gift, that machines are here to help us not hinder us!  \nLove you and my prayers to all you family and friends.","header":"Steve Jobs !!!!!!!!","author":"Herbert","location":"from Mount Shasta, CA"}
