{"mainText":"The world has truly lost an unparalleled visionary. Someone like him is \na person that will be remembered for decades, if not centuries, to come \nfor what he has done in so many areas. I remember racing classmates in \nelementary school for the Macs to play Brick Break. I grew up with \nmovies like Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and Toy Story 2. I continue to wait \nanxiously for their next movie, even as an adult in my mid-20's.&nbsp;To this day, I love my Apple products and wait baited breath for the \nnext revolutionary device/software to show what devices can truly \nachieve.&nbsp;My thoughts and prayers go out to the Jobs family and those \nfortunate enough to call him a friend.&nbsp;","header":"Condolences","author":"Eric","location":""}
