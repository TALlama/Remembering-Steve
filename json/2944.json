{"mainText":"\nI'm so glad &amp; proud that I grew up with Apple, I remember when I first ever got an iPod for Christmas in 2009, I thought to myself what the world has come to with a small touchscreen device that can connect with the world! Steve Jobs was the Leonardo Da Vinci of technology and most of all of my generation. Steve Jobs seriously was pure genius, unfortunately God always takes the incredible people of this planet first. Steve Jobs will always stay with us do to his amazing and incredible art of technology he brought to this world, and for the many others that tried to imitate his work but at the end of the day, Apple always ended up first place. \nMy prayers are with the Apple Company and Steve Jobs' family.","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Karla","location":"from Houston, TX"}
