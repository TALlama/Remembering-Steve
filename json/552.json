He created Apple which is a very successful company that has a \nvery bright future. He basically played a big part in creating the \nfuture. I personally look at Steve Jobs the same way I look at Albert \nEinstien, a pure genius. I wish the best for you and I'm sorry for your \nloss.\n","header":"remembering Steve Jobs","author":"Josh","location":""}
