{"mainText":"As I sit in my home office today, surrounded by Apple products big and \nsmall, it makes me very sad to hear of Steve's passing. I am struck by \nthe many ways I've been able to express myself through your products . . \n. I designed that artwork on an iMac . . . that blues song I wrote was \nrecorded in GarageBand . . . I sent that poem to my wife through \nMacMail. Sure, I guess I could have done all those things without Apple. \nBut Steve's vision made creating those things more enjoyable.\n\nThanks for giving a way to express ourselves, Steve. You'll be missed.","header":"Condolences","author":"Ryan","location":""}
