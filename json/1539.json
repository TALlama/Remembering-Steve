{"mainText":"\nI was saddened to see the announcement of Steve's passing.  \nI did not personally know the man, but his vision, his forward looking imagination, and ability to overcome great obstacles was amazing. Beyond all that though, we all could see he was struggling with his health and still managed to share his dreams and new products.  \nHe fought a good fight.  \nFor a man I have never met, I am in awe when I think how much of my life has been and will continue to be impacted by his life and work. Every phone call, everything I do on my lap top...my prayers are with his family and friends.&nbsp;","header":"a great man...","author":"Wayne","location":"from Canada"}
