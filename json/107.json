{"mainText":"Nothing I can say will ever relay how great of an impact Steve Jobs has had\non my life. I could tell you about all of the iPhones, iPads, iPods,\nhardware, and software that I've purchased or used... but that's not the\ntelling piece.\n\nI admire Steve Jobs - the leader, the visionary. His family saw him as a\ndad, a husband... I can't even imagine the pain their hearts are carrying\nright now. The world is mourning today, Steve, for you changed the lives of\nmillions and millions of people. Thank you for being one of the most\nprofound human beings this world will ever see.\n\nMy condolences to his family, the Apple family, and all of the lives he\ntouched during his short time on this Earth. God took Steve much too soon. I\nhope one day I have the chance to say, \"Thank you, Steve.\"\n\nGod bless.&nbsp;","header":"Always appreciated, always remembered","author":"Matt","location":""}
