{"mainText":"Hello,\nI cannot begin to express how sad I am about Steve's passing. I somehow hoped he'd get back on his feet again and return to us, but it wasn't meant to be.&nbsp;\nFrom my 1984 Mac sitting in the corner of my room, waiting to play pong and solitaire, to my Powerbook Duo, to my PPC, my iBook and my current Macbook, these computers have all changed and enhanced my life so much and I am so grateful for Steve's vision and perseverance over the years. Steve Jobs changed the world and made my life so much better for having the ability to make the magic my Macs have made for me over the years. I will always love him. In my heart, he's still the boss and his spirit is still with us in every Mac and everything made on a Mac, like movies and comic books, and magazines, etc. I pray that Apple will keep his visions alive and the company on the same track with visionary products and the \"Think Different\" attitude that made Apple the great company its become.","header":"I hoped this news would be many decades away","author":"Chrysta","location":""}
