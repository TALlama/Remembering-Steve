{"mainText":"Thank you, Steve, for saving Apple when times were dark.\n\nThank you for having the vision to take Apple places no-one thought it \ncould go. You certainly surprised me!\n\nI remember seeing the first \"Think Different\" commercial on TV late one \nnight and tearing up. I knew, then, change was coming. I knew you sent \nthat message out to us -- the faithful -- telling us that everything was \ngoing to be okay now that you were back. Telling us that things would \nnever be the same -- and they'll never be the same after the products \nyou helped create.\n\nI'll keep the faith. If ever I'm cut, I will always bleed in six colors.\n\nYou will be missed.\n\nMy heart goes out to your family.","header":"Thank you, Steve!","author":"Jason","location":"from Stockton, CA"}
