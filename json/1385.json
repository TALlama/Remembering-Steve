{"mainText":"\nI hereby give my message after the great man who was Steve Jobs. With his genius changed the world. In his private life, the family grew. An incredible human being, a visionary who was always on the cutting edge of innovation in the world. Pixar has created, and who made great films that delighted children and adults around the world. Apple's revamped image, creating great products like the iPod, iPad, the iPhone and Macintosh. He fought bravely, so far as he could, but unfortunately he left, although it was the best way possible: along with the family, quietly. Apple would not be as large as it is today without a major assist him, without his ideas, his genius and creativity. Sleep in peace Steve Jobs.","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Renato","location":"from Brazil"}
