{"mainText":"steve, \n\nI cannot tell you how much you touched and changed our lives in ways we could never have imagined. I live in Egypt and I remember when the Ipod first came out in the US how much I wanted it and how much I wanted to explore this new world that everyone is talking about. I called my uncle who lives in rochester, NY and I said “get me that ipod when you get here in a month. And I want the black one.” When I got it I felt extreme happiness. The amount of music that I had on that ipod was so huge that my mom said “The man who created that thing created an addiction.” But soon enough she became addicted herself since she bought the apple Iphone. All I want to say is thank you for taking us on a journey and showing us a beautiful world that we never thought existed. \n\nThank you steve and RIP.","header":":)","author":"Habiba","location":""}
