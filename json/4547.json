{"mainText":"I was sad to hear about Mr. Jobs passing.  Steve Jobs was a modern day \nWalt Disney.  Even though I never met the man or had the pleasure of \nworking with him at Apple his personality, and zest of creativity would \nalways show during his keynotes. Myself and my parents now use Apple products because of Mr. Jobs.  I \nhave inspired others to purchase Apple products because how it made my \nlife easier and fun.\n\nPlease give my best to his family, both at Apple and in his private \nlife.  I only hope that his vision will continue to inspire the next \ngeneration of technology.","header":"Thank you","author":"Heidi","location":""}
