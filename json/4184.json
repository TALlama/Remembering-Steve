{"mainText":"\nToday I graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Graphic Design, and my thesis I have fully processed to my good old macBook pro that I have from four years! Without the brain, the imagination, humility and passion of Steve would not be where I am now. I offer my condolences to the family, first and foremost, and to the great company that Apple has lost the sole creator and founder. I dedicate my thesis, I could never accomplish what I've done!! love you Steve,in your honor.","header":"from italy,a little thought for steve","author":"Silvia","location":"from Italy"}
