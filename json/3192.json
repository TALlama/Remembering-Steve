{"mainText":"\nHello,\nI am 17 years old and I am from Argentina. I have never bought an apple product. \nLast year I was at school and a teacher showed us a video from Steve Jobs' speech at Stanford University. It was so inspiring, he inspired millions of people. Apart from being a genius, because he was that kind of genius that can only exist in Hollywood movies, he was such an honest and simple person. \nWhile I remember him I do not remember the creator Apple, I can only remember this man who, with a speech, made everyone feel moved. I did, everybody in my class were moved.\nNow I can not stop tearing while I think about his family. This family who lost a husband, a father, a great man. So now I feel really sorry, but not for this amazing creator, but for this amazing man.&nbsp;","header":"","author":"Ayelen","location":"from Argentina"}
