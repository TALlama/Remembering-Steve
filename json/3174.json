{"mainText":"Mr Steve Jobs,\n\nThanks for creating the perfect hardware that runs even more perfect creative software that has allowed me to rise out of poverty and earn triple the salary of both my parents combined. For the wonderful life you have empowered me with I will continue to pay it forward in all I do everyday in your memory. We may have lost you on earth but heaven just got a lot more cooler.  Rest\n in Peace.","header":"What Steve Jobs did in my life I could never repay.","author":"Jim","location":""}
