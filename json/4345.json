{"mainText":"Even if I never met Steve myself I think of him as a visionary and\ninnovation person. Transformed his own company and ahead of the competition.\nI remember getting excited for his events and his way of showing the latest\ngadgets. His one more thing made us wanting more. I know apple will become\nsuccessful and its brighter days is in the future.\nSteve's micromanagement and persistent about his job hiding his health\ncondition as he worked in Apple showed Steve's perseverance.\n\nBest Regards\nGood Bye Steve Jobs\nHe will be missed.\n","header":"Remembering Steve Jobs","author":"Benny","location":""}
