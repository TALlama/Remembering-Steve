{"mainText":"I remember when I went from having an mp3 player to my first iPod! I like many others have contributed, and evolved with the apple brand. The person who we must remember is Steve Jobbs, he is the visionary of Apple, and whenever I use my apple products I will always remember the man who made all of this possible. I know that Apple as a company will continue to evolve and contribute to our society! Thank you Steve for everything you have given us to date, and through your hard work and motivation will be possible in the future.","header":"I remember...","author":"Jesse","location":""}
