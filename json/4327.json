{"mainText":"Beyond the incredible products Apple has produced, there is a legacy that if far more incredible.  I can't say I have even met the great man who has left this existence but from what I have know about him (I have read anything there has ever been printed, viewed anything that has ever been filmed and digested everything that I could) about Mr. Jobs.  In Apples products, you feel a connection, almost human at times that I feel he was trying to push towards.  I am deeply saddened by his passing and I wish his family and friends all the blessings and goodwill there are.  There never has been or ever will be someone like him.","header":"The World loses a truly phenomenal man","author":"Christopher","location":""}
