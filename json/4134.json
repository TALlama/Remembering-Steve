{"mainText":"Dear Steve,\n\n \n\nWhilst I am learning the way of your presentation, with power but of\nclarity, then this morning when I wake up I heard of such a shocking news\nwhich hit me much, losing such a spiritual and influential leader.  Life is\nfull of ups and downs and it is not how long you live which makes it count,\nit's how meaningful you create your life when you are still alive.\n\n \n\nRest in peace and my best wishes to you and your family.&nbsp;","header":"Steve blesses Steve","author":"Steve","location":"from China"}
