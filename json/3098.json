{"mainText":"It was 1993 when I attended the Academy of Art University in San  \nFrancisco using one of the first non linear machines operating on  \nMacintosh computers.  I began my love affair with Apple back then and  \nhave been using their machines ever since.  I got a chance to bump  \ninto Steve by accident in Palo Alto about 6 months ago and feel  \nprivileged to have met the man who changed my personal and career  \nlife.  Every time I use my Mac I will always feel a little bit of  \nSteve's presence encouraging me to dream and achieve. My condolences  \nto his friends and family. God bless you Steve. You will always be  \nwith us.&nbsp;","header":"His Vision Shaped my Life","author":"Russell","location":""}
