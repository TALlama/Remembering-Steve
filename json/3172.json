{"mainText":"\nI find myself extremely sad because I have always admired Steve Jobs. He was\n a landmark in its time and revolutionized the way we communicate, and if not this terrible disease I think his mind, aided by his team, would still be putting us in a world more practical, interactive, fun and happy. What remains to do is to thank the man, who in one way or another is present in our day to day and will always be part of world history. Thanks Steve Jobs.&nbsp;","header":"A man, a legend","author":"Fabiana","location":"from Brazil"}
