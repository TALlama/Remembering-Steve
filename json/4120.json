{"mainText":"\nI would like to extend my sincere condolences to Apple, its personnel and all that knew Steve on a personal basis. The effect Apple has had on the world under Steve's leadership is monumental. Apple is everywhere, touching people's lives regardless of race, religion, or other artificial variables used to fragment the unity that is humanity.\n\nI believe Steve aspired to bring us all back together and used technology to bring forth a brighter future. And despite the economic shocks and tremors we experience today, the world is really bright and colorful thanks to Apple and Steve Jobs who channeled our minds toward the positive.\n\nBlessed be his memory.","header":"Condolences","author":"Snorri","location":""}
