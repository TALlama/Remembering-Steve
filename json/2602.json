{"mainText":"As soon as I learned of Steve Job's death, the first thing I did was turn to my MacBook. It keeps me connected to what others out there are feeling, experiencing and wanting to say, and right now, that seems very, very important. I think that was part of what Steve wanted to accomplish for us all. And in his too short lifetime, he did. Because I can do this, right now, seamlessly, intuitively. He made it easy.&nbsp;I won't shut my laptop off tonight. It would seem sacrilegious.&nbsp;\n\nSteve was Apple's core. God bless him. And God bless Apple. Our lives have been changed positively in so many uncountable, intrinsic ways, personally &amp; professionally. A standard was created for visionary leadership, creative genius, dedication to ingenuity&nbsp;and corporate guidance. Combined with an&nbsp;intuitive understanding&nbsp;and true appreciation for the valuable relationship between product, service, consumer and industry is an achievement no one else has ever has matched.&nbsp;\n\nI think he understood life. I hope we all learn from him. I am only a consumer of Apple products, but I will miss him and truly mourn. My deepest condolences to his personal and professional family. He will be deeply missed.","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Carolyn","location":""}
