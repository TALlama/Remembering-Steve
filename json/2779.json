{"mainText":"\n\tI started as a computer science student without any background \nexperience or knowledge in the matter. But one day I heard Steve Jobs \nspeech. He made me realize that anything is possible if you are \ndetermined and not afraid to dream. Steve Jobs has changed the world \nwith his vision and genius. He will be always remembered and missed. I \nwish this is not happening but sadly we have to accept God's will.\n\nMy condolences to his family and friends.","header":"He is my hero and inspiration","author":"Bryan","location":""}
