{"mainText":"\nI remember Steve Jobs... the beginning of a new age of innovation. From the time that he began his career with technology, to the period in which he sought out the best of the best ideas. Today, I still utilize all my Apple products, because that spirit of Steve Jobs is with me and my family. Some of us may think of him the next day as someone who just recently passed away; he brought the goodness and memories into our hearts. I still will remember always the Mr. Jobs who brought the word \"Apple\" to a whole new meaning. One day we will all look back in our pasts and mourn the time of which Jobs created a blockbuster company so enormous, the world will see to it that everyone buys at least one product from the Apple website for centuries.\n\nMy deepest condolences,\na true fan of the modern technology and the man behind it: Steve Jobs.
