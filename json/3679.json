{"mainText":"This is equivalent to my mom's generation of Elvis dying for me. I am very\nsadden and emotionally moved at the moment. He was more influential on my\nlife than my parents and friends. While my parents loved me and friends\nshared fun times. Steve influenced me, motivated me to become the innovated,\ncreative technologist I have become.

We've lost a\nsignificant influence and icon in technology. We won't see another person of\nhis innovation and foresight within my life time. He was the Edison of\ntechnology. He was and is one of my biggest inspirations.\n\nI feel I have lost a close family member","header":"What Steve Jobs meant to me","author":"Skip","location":""}
