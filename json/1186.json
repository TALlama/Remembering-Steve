{"mainText":"Dear Apple,\n\nSteve Jobs, a modern day Leonardo Di Vinci of our era who and will forever\nbe known as a legend until the end of time.  i also want to thank all Apple\nemployees past and present who have had faith and believed in the nature and\nquality of your work.  Combined with Steve's inspiration and desire for\ncreativity such wonderful synergy was born and brought about an impressive\nline of Apple products &amp; services.  Its always an honor to work for a\ncompany that has the capacity to influence the world and inspire future\ngenerations of innovators.  Visionaries such as Steve appear maybe once a\ncentury.  Therefore Apple I hope you continue to truly honor Steve's life\nwork with the preservation of Steve's inspiration in all that you do... for\nwe all receive inspiration from within ourselves.&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs, a modern day Leonardo Di Vinci","author":"Jens","location":""}
