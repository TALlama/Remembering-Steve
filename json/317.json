{"mainText":"I have no words to express my deep sorrow on the passing of Steve. He has\nalways been an inspiration to me. He was bigger than life and represented what Silicon Valley is all about. I\nnever had the opportunity of meeting or seeing him in person, but have always admired him. He was, and still is my idol. I\nwill miss him. God bless him and his beautiful family.","header":"Remebering Steve","author":"Juan","location":"from Cupertino, California"}
