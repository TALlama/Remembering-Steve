{"mainText":"Like Steve, I was born in 1955, this is one reason why I am touch so deeply by his passing, I hoped and wished so much that he would win the battle with his decease. Unlike Steve I did not move the world, he did that in a big big way, for all of us.\nSteve left this place much much to early, I am so very sorry. My thoughts are with Steve's Family and all the good people who are close to him.\nGod bless his soul - He left us but he will always be with us.\nMy 56th birthday is coming up this month of October - That day, more than ever I'll be thinking of Steve Jobs.&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Peter","location":""}
