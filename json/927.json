{"mainText":"I was driving this evening on the way home listening to NPR when the broadcast was interrupted with the news of Steve's death. It came as a tremendous shock, I am still numb from the news.  I came to America in 1988.  Through the years I have been following Steve because of the inspiration and motivation he has provided in my personal life. I left Mechanical Engineering for the\n computer world because of Steve.  I have now been in IT for 13 years.  He was the manifestation of courage in the Technology world. We have lost more than a leader, we have lost a true friend.&nbsp;","header":"I love Steve","author":"Hamed","location":"from Gaithersburg, Maryland"}
