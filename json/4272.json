{"mainText":"I would just like to say that Steve Jobs changed my life for the better.\nWithout him I don't know what I would be doing right now. This morning, the\nday when Jobs passed away, my friends were talking about how Macs weren't as\ngood as Windows, but that day, I defended him. I defended his intelligence\nand the impact he has made on so many lives. It's a sad thing to hear that\nthis wonderful intelligent person went with the wind like many others these\npast few years, but at least he chose to found the company that would change\ntechnology forever... Steve Jobs was an indescribably great person, and we\nall hope that he will rest in peace","header":"Remembering Steve Jobs","author":"Michael","location":""}
