{"mainText":"I don't know what to say. It was one of my greatest wish to meet steve jobs one day in my life even only to shake hands. He was inspiring me in so many ways. I\n have to say that i start to get interested in his works in the last two years\n, and it was for me like a new world has opend. I feel kind in the way that we have some in common, life is to short to fullfill your ideas and Steve was\n just starting. He changed the world in a wonderful way, he gave the computer a taste of soul, where nobody would have ever searched for this before. Nobody &nbsp;understands humans like Steve. His empathy for humans and computer was what he was best in, he understood the needs of the people and want to make them happy. He was a good man. He will be missed. My condolence for his family and his friends, also for the Apple employees, keep working on his ideas and dreams and he will be never forgotten.&nbsp;","header":"I have lost my idol","author":"Jan","location":""}
