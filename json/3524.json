My son worked for Apple, and based on his training  \n(help the customer to buy what they need and not what they think they  \nwant),  says volumes for the integrity of the company.  My family is  \nsadden by this loss and for his family and those who were close to  \nhim.  We will pray for all of you.","header":"a broken heart","author":"An Apple Family","location":"from Austin, Texas"}
