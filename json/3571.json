{"mainText":"The very first computer I ever laid my hands on was an IBM compatible \nrunning Windows 3.1. For me then,  I thought that computer  was so \nfantastic and awesome. Then when I became a Fashion Illustrator, I was \nintroduced to the Macintosh, a Quadra 950 to be exact...everything then \nchanged for me as far as desktop computers are concerned...everything is \nso intuitive, easy and gives me more freedom to create! As I became more \nfascinated with the Mac, I got to learn more about the two \nSteve's....specially Steve Jobs. Not only was he the face of Apple but \nhe has this simple brilliance in combining sleek design aesthetics and \nlatest computer innovations...No wonder I later  became a Graphics \nSpecialist for an Apple Disitributer....kudos to you Mr Jobs...rest in \nApple heaven!\n\nThank You for all the memories!&nbsp;","header":"Rest In Peace and Thanks!","author":"Eusebio","location":""}
