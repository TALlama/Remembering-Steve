{"mainText":"Although I never had the pleasure of meeting steve I feel truly sorry to hear of his passing. It is a reminder to us all how fragile life is, and that we must do everything in our power to make this life count. I truly believe that he did just that. I want to extend my deepest sympathy to all his family, friends, and everyone else that had the privilege of knowing him. I hope Mr. Jobs had a personal relationship with God, so that I might have the privilege of meeting him one day.&nbsp;","header":"","author":"Chris","location":""}
