{"mainText":"\n\nTuning in to Apple product launches has become a regular activity for me in recent years.&nbsp;I would look forward&nbsp;to them like a kid on Christmas morning. Even though I may not have been able to purchase the item on the day it was released or even shortly thereafter - &nbsp;I could dream. \n\n\n\nMy family and I are the proud owners of IPads, the ITouch and multiple IPods. I have a 4 year old who proudly knows how to use his daddy's IPad and our next laptop will be a Mac.&nbsp;None of this would have occurred without the leadership and vision of Steve Jobs! Thanks Steve and thanks to your family for sharing you with us all these years.&nbsp;","header":"With Sympathy","author":"Patricia","location":"from VA"}
