{"mainText":"Steve jobs created the twenty first century, I am devastated of his loss, I remember when I got my first Ipod I was in 5th grade and it was the coolest thing that had ever happened to me, he not only created a technology epidemic but a musical one as well, his technology has spread to parts unknown, and in result the world has came closer together. Steve was The Leonardo Davinci of our time, and for that we thank you Steve and my you rest in peace.","header":"","author":"Edward","location":""}
