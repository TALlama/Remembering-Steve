I truly want to thank Steve for creating products that\npeople will be using for generations to come.  More importantly, for helping\nmy child communicate more effectively to us through the iPad.\n\n\nRest in peace and ensure that our prayers are with his family.","header":"Thank You","author":"Brian","location":""}
