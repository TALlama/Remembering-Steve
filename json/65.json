{"mainText":"\tMy condolences to the Jobs family. Steve Jobs was by far and \naway my idol, and if I could one day affect the people in my life in \nHALF the ways that he affected THE WORLD, I would be lucky. I always \nviewed Mr. Jobs as a person who not only worked incredibly hard at his \njob, but loved it. From what I could tell, giving up his position was \nsomething that he would not have chosen to do if he had the option. I'm \na fifteen year old girl, and I really don't have any idea what I want to \ndo with my life, but I would hope to one day grow up to be as dedicated \nas Mr. Jobs. I can say that the world has a lost someone who cared about \nthe consumer, which I believe is a rare thing in the corporate world.&nbsp;","header":"RIP Steve Jobs","author":"Anna","location":"from Kansas"}
