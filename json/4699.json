{"mainText":"Dear Representatives at Apple, I send my condolences to Apple over their loss. I've had my \nMacbook and iPhone since 7th grade (I am a Junior in High School now), \nand I must say that if I didn't have either, I would not have been as \nproductive as I am now! Steve really changed the world in many aspects, \nand I feel that without him, the world wouldn't have been just the same. \nRest in Peace Steve, you shall not be forgotten.&nbsp;","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Ashvik","location":""}
