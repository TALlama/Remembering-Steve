{"mainText":"While I never personally knew the guy, I have had the honor and privilege to work for the company that Steve Jobs has started, for a little under a year. Even though I have been with the company for a short time, I credit Apple with helping me become a better person not only professionally, but personally as well. The culture of the company Steve created allowed me to meet a wide range of amazing and inspirational people. Never have I been able to wake up and enjoy going to work every single day. Youâ€™re company has changed my life not only by the products that you have created, but by the people chosen to represent the brand. I will be forever grateful.\n\nThank you Mr. Jobs, the world has lost a hero.","header":"Thank You.","author":"Joe","location":"from Philadelphia, PA"}
