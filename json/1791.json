{"mainText":"Steve Jobs not only changed the way we interact with technology, but with ea\nch other. He has taught me so much through his legendary Keynote addresses at product launches. He was a brilliant speaker who knew how to get people behind him and his product. But he was much more than that. He was the man who\n co-created the world's largest company. He lived the American Dream to it's\n fullest.
