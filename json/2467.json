{"mainText":"My deepest condolences to the family of Steve Jobs for a wonderful man he\nwas. I would like to say that he has forever changed the way we think of\ntechnology and innovation and Apple was his creation and forever live in\nmemory of him. I was always impressed by the way he could stir up a crowd.\nHe would make us believe in fantasies again. That we can always do better. I\nwould like to say he is an icon my generation will never forget and one that\nwill live on to the next. Thank you Steve Jobs R.I.P.","header":"R.I.P Steve Jobs","author":"Zachary","location":""}
