{"mainText":"My well wishes, thoughts and prayers go out to Mr. Jobs and his family. We\n(humanity as a whole) have lost a great man who has moved mankind forward so\nmuch in such a short period of time.\n\nAlthough Apple and its products never really appealed to me, I always\nrespected the passion, dedication and never ending attention to detail that\nMr. Jobs brought to everything he ever worked with or on. The interesting\nthing is that it is this mantra of his that has slowly started to change\neven someone as stubborn as I am and make change my thoughts on Apple.\n\nMay he rest in peace and may his family and friends find peace and pride\nwith being related to a man that will no doubt be written about in history\nbooks as one of the greatest men of all time.&nbsp;","header":"He will always be remembered...","author":"Naveed","location":""}
