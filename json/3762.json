{"mainText":"Growing up as a kid in the 60's and 70's I never would have even dreamed that technology could be what it is today.  I remember getting my first AM transistor radio and thinking how amazing that was with the one earpiece!\n\nSteve Jobs made my kids world a whole lot better than what I had as a kid.  Thank you Steve Jobs for my iPad, iPhone, iMac, and iPod.  You made it possible for all of us to have extremely cool communication devices, our music at a\n touch, and you were just an all around good guy. Thank you for how you changed my life and have inspired me to go after my dreams and if it's not out there, then invent it.  You are an inspiration to me and will always be.\n\nGod bless your family and I pray that they are comforted by the Lord.&nbsp;","header":"I'm so sorry to hear the news.","author":"Paul","location":""}
