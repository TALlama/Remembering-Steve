{"mainText":"I never met Steve Jobs. However, his genius makes my life more enjoyable and my job more efficient as I use the products he and the others at Apple have devised. I am not a \"switcher.\" I can honestly say as a 40 year old male that I have owned only Apple products and they have never let me down.\n\nWhen I got the news that he had resigned, I knew that his death was probably near. But when I got the \"breaking news\" email that he had passed away, my heart sank. I know he is irreplaceable in many ways, but I hope Apple continues down the path that Steve blazed in creating such high quality, beautiful and dependable products that \"just work.\"\n\nWe are most like God when we are creative. Well, Steve was a creative genius. I pray he was at peace with his Maker. They will have a lot to discuss!","header":"Steve Jobs","author":"Kevin","location":""}
