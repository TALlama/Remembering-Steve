{"mainText":"My dear Apple friends;\n\nFrom time to time one human being shapes the lives of the rest of use. Commonly they come from politics or religion...the social and cultural fabric of our lives.\nNot very often scientists and inventors shape the world. Typically it is done by what they create. A thing that determines the lives of others. \n\nAlthough Steve Jobs shaped lives through his invention he shaped mine through communicating the essence of quality in the human world. These are the ideas that shaped me and are now part of my fabric as an individual. As an Apple Creative I learned to be concerned about humanity first, technology second. Products were simply tools to help solve the problems or better yet unleash the potential of us all. Perhaps no other creative genius enabled that more that the work Apple did...lead by Steve Jobs.\n\nEdison's lightbulb and phonograph were startling and entertaining. They improved life but had limited impact on people's innate talents. Ford's automobile moved us from place to place. But the creations of Apple (Mr. Jobs) not only made our lives and ideas more moveable....they allowed an individual expression and freeing of creative energy that has never been before. We all owe a great debt to Steve Jobs. I know I personally do.\n\nWhen I was in training in Cupertino I saw Steve on campus. Really a down-to-earth type of man. Yet he believed in big ideas and trusted his own. And he wanted us all to trust ours...to think different...to think for ourselves. That is a lesson the world needs now more than ever.\n\nIn that vein I plan to redouble my own efforts to...change the world.\n\nSo, continue to think and act big Apple friends. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain.\n\nThank you Steve!&nbsp;","header":"The Loss","author":"Craig","location":""}
