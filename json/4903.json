He inspired me as child and fascinated me\nwith his ideas through his products from computers to iPods to iPhones and\niPads. His candle burned twice as bright as any man and will definitely\nleave a mark on mankind for generations to come and I am glad and honored to\nsay I lived and experienced his innovations first hand. God bless you in\nyour time of mourning.","header":"Condolences","author":"Shawn","location":""}
