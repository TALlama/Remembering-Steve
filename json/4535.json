{"mainText":"What made Steve Jobs special, I believe, was his optimistic view of life and his vision of what his company could achieve to make a positive contribution to the world and the lives of others.

May his positive view and energies continue on to inspire the world and the next generation of entrepreneurs.","header":"Remembering Steve","author":"Thomas","location":""}
