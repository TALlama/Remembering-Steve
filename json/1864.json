Just&nbsp; minutes before the sad news, I share with my Mom\n, in my new iPad, the video of \"my new personal assistant.\n\nToday I feel sad, it's an emptiness. Today we lost an extraordinary visionary.\n\nRest in peace, we always remember You though Apple, You change the way we li\nve, You change the world, You change the taste of The Apple.
